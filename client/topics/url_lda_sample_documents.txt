8.400316579105014e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:48:48 +0000 2017	"President Donald Trump ’s administration is taking credit for a decrease in the number of border apprehensions during the president’s first full month in office.  But lower numbers could indicate that the administration’s increasingly heavy-handed immigration policy  is just deterring people who are fleeing violence from seeking asylum in the United States, critics say.  The border is “already responding to the president’s agenda, even while we’re still in the beginning stages of putting his policies in place,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday at a briefing. And while announcing the latest border apprehension figures, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly referenced changes that have taken place since Trump won the election in November and was inaugurated on Jan. 20. “[T]he early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact,” Kelly said Wednesday evening in a statement . They could be right. Experts agree that enforcement ― along with other factors like the economy and conditions in an immigrant’s native country ― has an effect on border crossings. And the drop in apprehension numbers is certainly a sizable one. Unauthorized crossings from Mexico have declined steadily since the economic crisis of 2008. But the figure crept up again  over the last three years , as a growing number of Central American nationals have entered the U.S., often fleeing violence and seeking refuge . Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border  dropped from about 31,600 in January to about 18,800 in February, according to Customs and Border Protection, a drop Kelly called “unprecedented.” The federal government and analysts who study immigration use apprehension figures as an indicator of how many people are attempting to come to the U.S. without authorization. Still, it’s far too soon to say whether Trump’s deportation policies account for the decline in unauthorized immigration. It’s also far too simplistic an argument to make about thousands of individuals and families, each making their own decisions about whether to risk their safety by attempting to enter the U.S. without a visa. And after only two months in office, the Trump administration has yet to make practical changes to boost enforcement along the border, such as hiring more Border Patrol agents or expanding immigrant detention capacity.   Carlos Barria / Reuters President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in Washington on Feb. 28. The White House says his aggressive stance on immigration enforcement is already leading to a drop in illegal border crossings, but critics accuse him of upending the asylum process. Immigration experts and legal groups suspect the White House has undercut the asylum process to bring down the numbers of apprehensions for illegal entry. Alex Mensing, a paralegal with the University of San Francisco Immigration and Deportation Defense Law Clinic, has traveled to Tijuana twice in the last four months. While there, he has worked with two dozen migrants who tried to claim asylum in the U.S. In the past, migrants have been allowed to walk into California by crossing the bridge at the San Ysidro port of entry, Mensing said. There, they have the right to ask for asylum under international law. Private security guards and CBP agents more recently have directed migrants toward a Mexican branch of the immigration system called Grupos Beta , where they were told to wait. Such practices appear to be becoming more common,  The Washington Post  reported in January.  “There are people who would have been a number on the statistics of apprehensions at the border who are not because they were turned away by a Customs and Border Protection officer who wasn’t allowed to do that,” Mensing told The Huffington Post. “And there are people who have not become a number because they never tried because Mexican immigration officials ― specifically Grupos Beta ― told them they didn’t qualify for relief.” Mexico’s National Institute of Migration did not respond to a request for comment. There are people who would have been a number on the statistics of apprehensions at the border who are not because they were turned away by a Customs and Border Protection officer who wasn’t allowed to do that. Alex Mensing of the San Francisco Immigration and Deportation Defense Law Clinic CBP denies turning away asylum seekers from legal ports of entry. “A s we continue to work towards protecting our borders, CBP has not changed any policies affecting asylum procedures,” an agency spokesman wrote in an email to HuffPost. “These procedures are based on international law and are focused on protecting some of the world’s most vulnerable and persecuted people. As an agency CBP does not tolerate any kind of abuse.” But Amy Fischer ― the policy director for RAICES, a group that offers legal services to immigrants in family detention ― said clients have said CBP has dissuaded them from entering the United States to make claims for asylum or other humanitarian relief. One client, who declined to be named for fear of jeopardizing her asylum claim, says she tried to enter the U.S. by crossing the Hidalgo bridge into Texas. She says she paid the toll to enter the bridge five times, and then U.S. immigration officials approached her in line to say she should leave because the U.S. was no longer taking Honduran asylum claims. “You all don’t have entrance anymore,” a border officer once told her and her husband, the RAICES client wrote in an affidavit. She made it across on March 2 ― her sixth try ― while accompanied by a lawyer who had met her at a shelter in Reynosa, Mexico. “The message that was put out this morning [by the Trump administration] failed to acknowledge the fact that the majority of people that come to our border are coming to seek asylum,” Fischer told HuffPost. “So if they’re not coming, where are they going? We know there has not been a drastic drop in the violence in Central America, so what is happening to these people?” There are other factors that indicate Trump can’t take all the credit for the declining numbers. Cuban nationals who were allowed into the United States without visas under a 1960s-era policy can no longer freely enter the country. Obama ended the so-called “wet-foot, dry foot” policy on Jan. 12 . Before he axed the policy, between 3,200 and 5,000 Cubans entered the United States without visas each month . That number plummeted to 65 in February. The numbers of Haitian migrants ― thousands of whom crossed into the United States over the fall and early winter seeking humanitarian relief ― have likewise dropped precipitously, from 3,471 in October to 218 in February. Mary Giovagnoli, who worked as deputy assistant secretary for immigration policy with DHS under Obama, said it’s too early to tell whether the numbers mark a significant shift or a continuation of long-term trends. The raw figures published by CBP had yet to be reconciled with data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she said. Attorneys with the American Immigration Council, where Giovagnoli now serves as a senior fellow, had also heard about changes to the way CBP is handling claims for humanitarian relief. And even if the number of Central American families and unaccompanied minors seeking asylum dropped, they continued to make up a large chunk of the apprehensions that CBP recorded since Trump took office.   “In terms of the data, perhaps it’s just jumping the gun a little bit,” Giovagnoli said. “It’s a big guessing game at this point.” CBP apprehended about 3,100 family units at the southwest border in February, along with about 1,900 children traveling without their parents. That was down from January, when agents apprehended 9,300 families and about 4,400 unaccompanied minors. It’s possible that fear of Trump’s policies has made it to Central America, said  Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at Migration Policy Institute and former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. “There probably is a wait-and-see kind of a sense that has set in while people try to figure out whether things really are going to change or not,” she said, stressing that it’s too soon to say whether the drop in apprehensions will continue. Another potential explanation for the decrease in crossings is that some people are having trouble affording fees for smugglers to help them get across the border. Kelly said in his statement that smugglers in some areas have raised their fees by 130 percent since November 2016 ― something that is likely connected to Trump, since that was when he won the election ― and attributed the increase in fee to “changes in U.S. policy, including the detention of apprehended aliens.” It’s difficult to say why these so-called “coyotes” raised their rates. But whatever the reason, it could have an effect: It’s easier for a family or individual to come up with $3,500 than it is to find $8,000, the figures Kelly cited for an increase in some areas. Some people, particularly mothers, fathers and children who fear for their lives in Central America, are likely to come regardless of what efforts the administration makes regarding deterrence, said Maureen Meyer of WOLA, an organization devoted to human rights in the Americas. She said she spoke to some families in Mexico last month who were planning to come to the U.S.  because they feared staying in Central America ― but most didn’t know much about Trump’s policy changes. “These things take a while to trickle down,” Meyer said, noting that it also can take weeks to make the journey that people often start because they were threatened in their native country. “For certain people, deterrence isn’t really factoring into their equation,” she said, “either because they’re so desperate to get back to the United States because it’s their home and their entire family is here or, in the case of a lot of the families that are coming from Central America or the unaccompanied children, because they’re fleeing for their lives.” CORRECTION: This article originally stated that the RAICES client mentioned in the piece crossed into the U.S. with a lawyer from the group.

8.400272408595948e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:31:15 +0000 2017	"With his jacket off and sleeves rolled up, House Speaker Paul Ryan made the case for the Republican health care law Thursday, walking through a 35-minute PowerPoint presentation to a packed crowd of reporters and millions of viewers watching on the three cable TV networks. It was quintessential Ryan, calmly explaining the details of the American Health Care Act looking more like a college professor than a professional politician. But in making his case, Ryan made a series of misleading statements, both about the current state of Obamacare and the details of the replacement bill. Three stand out: 1. Cherry-picking premium costs. The numbers Ryan cited are scary: Premiums for a benchmark plan in the ACA marketplace rose 59 percent in Minnesota this year, 53 percent in Pennsylvania, 63 percent in Tennessee, 58 percent in Alabama, 69 percent in Oklahoma and 51 percent in Nebraska. “Arizona,” he said, “clocked in at a 116 percent increase in their health insurance premiums with Obamacare.” His numbers aren’t wrong—they come from a report from the Department of Health and Human Services, released last fall. But Ryan is cherry-picking the states with the highest premium increases. He doesn’t mention that premiums rose just 2 percent in New Hampshire, 5 percent in New Jersey, 2 percent in Ohio or 2 percent in Arkansas. In Indiana and Massachusetts, premiums actually fell. He also doesn’t mention that Americans are often protected from those rising premium increases by their subsidies, which increase as premiums rise. That’s not free—the extra cost is borne by taxpayers—but it draws an inaccurate picture of how premium hikes are actually hitting enrollees nationwide. 2. Obamacare in a death spiral? It’s Ryan’s favorite Obamacare talking point: Obamacare, he says, is in a death spiral. It sounds scary, but to health care economists, “death spiral” actually has a specific definition. It happens when premiums rise so much that young, healthy people drop out of the insurance market, creating a costlier “risk pool” of insured people, and forcing insurers to raise premiums again. That leads more healthy people to drop out until only sick people remain. The key sign that an insurance market is in a death spiral is if enrollment is dropping significantly—especially among the young. Is that happening with Obamacare? Not exactly. As I wrote when Ryan used this claim in January, enrollment in Obamacare insurance markets isn’t rising, as Democrats hoped, but it’s not collapsing either. We don’t have full data on sign-ups for 2017 Obamacare plans. But HHS has said that 9.2 million Americans signed up for insurance on the federal exchange, down from 9.4 million last year. That slight drop isn’t a good sign for Obamacare supporters, who blame the decline on the Trump administration’s decision to scale back advertising for the law. But it isn’t a giant slide, either. We’ll know more once final figures for the state exchanges come in. What’s happening with the young enrollees that the system needs to keep buying insurance? That’s unclear. A January HHS report found that 26 percent of enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34, down from 28 percent last year. Those are concerning numbers; the Obama administration’s original goal was 40 percent. But they aren’t a large enough decline to precipitate a death spiral, economists have said. And there are even signs that the market is stabilizing: S&P projected smaller losses for insurers in 2017 than in 2016. 3. Obamacare causes “job lock?”? Ryan also claimed Thursday that “Obamacare produces job lock,” pointing to a 2014 Congressional Budget Office report as evidence. Ryan gets this exactly wrong. Job lock is an economic term for when a person cannot leave a job for fear of losing health insurance. A 59-year-old with a pre-existing condition who wants to retire may keep working to afford insurance, or a 30-year-old would-be entrepreneur may forgo starting his own business because of insurance costs. This was a problem with the health insurance system before Obamacare, which the current law went a long way toward solving. Ryan has this backward when he says Obamacare produces job lock. It’s more likely Ryan misspoke here; the rest of his comments were not about job lock but instead about a different issue. Even if we assume he meant something else, he still is misleading the public. What Ryan intended to say is that Obamacare discourages people from working, because as their income rises, their insurance subsidies fall. CBO projected that the law would lead to a reduction in 2.5 million full-time-equivalent jobs in 2024 because people both would no longer need a job to receive health insurance—a reduction in job lock—and the loss of subsidies would discourage them from working and earning higher salaries. Ryan and his Republican colleagues have long criticized this element of Obamacare, and Ryan said Thursday that the GOP bill avoids this pitfall. “We don't want federal tax law or tax credits to ever encourage a person not to advance, not to get a raise, not to take a job,” he explained. But the Republican health care plan actually does do that. In their legislation, tax credits phase out starting at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for families. Those income thresholds are higher than the thresholds under Obamacare. But they still will cause families to lose subsidies as their income increases—and it won’t just happen for people making a million dollars, as Ryan suggested Thursday. "
8.40026390477058e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:27:53 +0000 2017	"SEOUL — South Korean President Park Geun-hye was removed from office Friday, as the country’s Constitutional Court unanimously upheld a parliamentary vote to impeach her for her role in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal. Elections for a new president must now be held within 60 days, and polls point to a change in political direction for South Korea. Progressive candidate Moon Jae-in holds a strong lead over the conservatives who were once loyal to Park. “The court dismisses President Park Geun-hye from her position,” said Lee Jung-mi, the acting chief justice, delivering the highly anticipated verdict Friday. “There is no other choice but to decide this verdict.” Park did not make any comment on the decision and remained in the presidential Blue House on Friday afternoon. Hwang Kyo-ahn, the caretaker prime minister who is now acting president, declared South Korea to be in an “emergency” situation, saying he would try to ensure stability and assuage international concerns. The impeachment marks a historic moment in a country that adopted democracy only 30 years ago. In sharp contrast with South Korea’s history of military coups, peaceful protests this time led to the removal of an elected leader. But supporters of Park wasted no time in venting their anger Friday morning, clashing with riot police and breaching cordons around the court.   Two people were reported to have died during the protests. The case has rocked South Korean society because of the sheer extent of the alleged corruption: Not only is the presidential Blue House implicated, but also the chiefs of leading companies such as Samsung, a high-profile prosecutor and the head of the national pension fund, the world’s third-largest. The case comes at a time of high tensions in the region, with North Korea firing missiles and issuing threats, and an angry China retaliating against South Korea for hosting an American anti­missile battery, which Beijing views as an effort to curtail China. All eight justices on the Constitutional Court voted to uphold the impeachment motion against Park, which passed by an  overwhelming majority in the National Assembly in December. The justices said the president had “continuously” violated the law and the constitution. The court concluded that the president had helped her friend Choi Soon-sil extract bribes from South Korean conglomerates  and had personally asked big business for donations. She had leaked confidential documents to Choi, tried to cover up her wrongdoing, then lied about it. The justices also chastised Park for refusing to answer questions about the case. “The negative impact of the president’s legal violations is serious, and the benefits to defending the constitution by dismissing her from office are overwhelmingly large,” the acting chief justice said in reading out the court’s ruling. [ South Korean prosecutors say president colluded in corruption scandal ] Analysts had expected the impeachment decision. People celebrate in front of the Constitutional Court in Seoul after hearing that President Park Geun-hye's impeachment was affirmed. (Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters) “It was such an obvious case that there was no room for the court to rule other than impeaching the president,” said Kim Seon-taek, a professor of constitutional law at Korea University. “Through the ‘Choi-gate’ investigation, we found serious violations of laws and evidence of meddling with law and order of the nation by both Choi Soon-sil and Park Geun-hye,” Kim said.  But Park’s lawyers vowed to fight on. “I cannot accept today’s conclusion,” attorney Suh Suk-koo told reporters outside the court, saying they would consider appealing. “The biased Korean media, coupled with left-leaning and North Korean sympathizing labor unions, have led anti-Park protests to the streets of South Korea.” Park’s supporters, mainly older, conservative Koreans, began protesting outside the court immediately after the decision, pushing through riot police and climbing over barricades around the court. Several people were seen unconscious on the ground. [ Samsung scion to be indicted on bribery charges ] The political scandal — extraordinary even by the standards of South Korea’s tumultuous democracy — revolves around Park and her  lifelong friend, Choi , who held no official position but turned out to wield huge influence over the president, much more than her official advisers and ministers.   Choi is accused of extracting bribes from big business — Samsung alone is accused of planning to give her $37 million — in return for using her relationship with the president to ensure favorable treatment for the companies.  Special prosecutors tasked with investigating the case, known here as “Choi-gate,” said in a 101-page report released this week that they had found evidence that the president colluded with Choi. Park refused to be questioned by the special prosecutors.  Prosecutors have recommended 13 charges against Park, including abuse of power, coercion of donations and the sharing of state secrets. Park had immunity from prosecution while she was in office but has lost that now that she has been removed from the presidency.  The release of the prosecutors’ report coincided with the conclusion of the Constitutional Court’s 10-week-long deliberation on the impeachment case. Park declined to appear before the court, although she issued statements through her lawyers in which she had steadfastly denied wrongdoing.  “The case couldn’t have been any clearer,” said Chung Tae-ho of Kyung Hee University. “With this verdict, the Constitutional Court has sent an unequivocal warning to the people in power not to take advantage of their positions and seek personal gains.”  [ Presidential scandal shows that ‘Korean disease’ of corruption is far from cured ] Park was suspended from office in December after weeks of enormous protests, with hundreds of thousands of people packing the streets of Seoul every Saturday, calling on her to resign or be impeached.  The outrage against her was triggered by revelations that the president, who seldom consulted with her ministers and official advisers, had been taking secret counsel on everything from North Korea policy to her wardrobe choices from a friend who held no official position.  Making matters worse, it turned out that Choi, the daughter of a shaman cult leader, had appeared to take advantage of her relationship with the president to enrich herself and win favors for her family.  She is accused of receiving about $70 million in bribes from big business groups. Park adamantly denied all the allegations. Samsung’s de facto head, Lee Jae-yong, went on trial Thursday on charges including bribery, embezzlement and perjury, and Choi has been on trial for months.   Both strongly deny wrongdoing, although at a parliamentary hearing in December, Lee admitted that Samsung had given a $900,000 horse to Choi’s daughter, an Olympic equestrian hopeful.  Now that Park has been ousted permanently, new elections must be held within 60 days.  The conservative faction is in disarray, with the ruling party splitting into those who supported the president and those wanting to distance themselves from her.   The latest polls put Moon, a progressive from the Democratic Party who ran against Park in the last presidential election, in the lead, although he is facing a surprise  primary challenge from An Hee-jung .  Moon has taken a much more conciliatory approach toward North Korea than the conservative governments that have held power since 2008, and his election would likely see the resumption of a “sunshine policy” of engagement with the North. [ South Koreans gather en masse to protest president ] Park, 65, is the daughter of former military strongman Park Chung-hee, who served as president from 1963 to 1979 and oversaw South Korea’s transformation into an economic powerhouse by supporting conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai.   Park Geun-hye has long been considered a kind of princess figure in South Korea, and one with a traumatic past. While she was in college, her mother was killed by a bullet meant for her father, shot by a North Korean sympathizer. Even today, Park wears an old-fashioned hairstyle reminiscent of her mother’s.  She effectively became South Korea’s first lady at 22, and during this time became close to Choi Tae-min, the founder of a religious cult that incorporated elements of Christianity and Buddhism. He would “deliver messages” to Park from her dead mother, according to local reports. A U.S. Embassy cable noted that the local media described Choi as a “Korean Rasputin.”  Park also became close to Choi’s daughter, Choi Soon-sil, and their friendship continued after both their fathers died.   Park’s father, still president, was killed in 1979 by his own spy chief, and Park disappeared from public view for almost two decades.  Read more: South Korean court to begin considering president’s impeachment Little-known governor runs as the hope and change candidate in South Korea Blaming ‘fake news,’ Ban Ki-moon drops presidential bid in South Korea Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.

8.40026081214251e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:26:39 +0000 2017	"The Turkish government's connection to retired general Michael Flynn's client was first reported by the Daily Caller. | Getty A company tied to Erdogan's government hired retired general Michael Flynn's lobbying firm. Donald Trump wants to forbid his officials from lobbying for foreign governments, but one of his top national security advisers is being paid by a close ally of Turkey's president. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a vice chair of the Trump transition who is in the running for a top national security post in the new administration, runs a consulting firm that is lobbying for Turkish interests, an associate told POLITICO. Asked if Flynn's firm was hired because of the general's closeness to Trump, the associate, Robert Kelley, said, ""I hope so."" Story Continued Below Kelley told POLITICO that the client, a Dutch consulting firm called Inovo BV, was founded by Kamil Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin is chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council, known as TAIK, an arm of the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey, whose members are chosen by the country's general assembly and economic minister. In that role, Alptekin was involved in organizing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Washington earlier this year. The Turkish government's connection to Flynn's client was first reported by the Daily Caller . A lobbying registration posted Sept. 30 said that Kelley, a former chief counsel to the House National Security Subcommittee, would lobby on bills funding the departments of State and Defense. ""We're going to keep them informed of U.S. foreign and domestic policy,"" Kelley said in a phone interview. ""They want to keep posted on what we all want to be informed of: the present situation, the transition between President Obama and President-Elect Trump."" Kelley said he didn't know if the client presented a conflict of interest. A spokesman for Flynn said he was too busy to answer questions. The Trump transition didn't answer a request for comment. The "" contract with the American voter "" released by the Trump transition pledges to instate ""a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government."" Kelley and Alptekin both denied that Inovo, which was formed in 2005, is linked to the Turkish government. ""Flynn Intel Group has no commercial relationship with the government of Turkey and Lt. General Michael Flynn's public statements on foreign affairs and national security issues are entirely his own,"" Kelley said in a subsequent statement. ""I am concerned about the future of the transatlantic relationship,"" Alptekin said in an email. ""I have absolutely no affiliation with the policies of the Turkish government."" Flynn wrote an op-ed published in The Hill on Election Day arguing that the U.S. should not provide ""safe haven"" to Fethullah Gülen, the Pennsylvania-based cleric who the Turkish government has accused of masterminding this summer's failed coup. (Gülen denies the allegation.) ""We need to see the world from Turkey’s perspective,"" Flynn wrote. ""What would we have done if right after 9/11 we heard the news that Osama bin Laden lives in a nice villa at a Turkish resort while running 160 charter schools funded by the Turkish taxpayers?"" Flynn compared Gülen to Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran and tied Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin to an academic journal that he said promoted ""radical Muslim thinkers."" (A Washington Post fact-check debunked that characterization of the journal.) He did not disclose his firm's lobbying contract in the article. Kelley said he didn't know if Flynn's op-ed was related to the lobbying contract. But he suggested reading a recent New Yorker article about Gulen that gave credence to his followers' role in the attempted overthrow. Alptekin told POLITICO the op-ed wasn't done for him. ""If he had asked me whether to publish it, I would have advised against it for a variety of reasons,"" he said. ""But frankly, I do not think General Flynn consults anyone before giving his opinion on national security issues."" In response to the op-ed, Gülen's lawyers at Steptoe & Johnson said in a statement, “We hope that Mr. Flynn’s op-ed on Mr. Gülen and Turkish-American relations, published before the results of the election were known, is not a statement of policy for President-Elect Trump. The extradition process is a serious one, governed by treaty with Turkey that is clear about the steps that need to be taken in such cases. It should not be a political matter."" The Alliance for Shared Values, a nonprofit affiliated with the Gulenist movement in the U.S., said hiring Flynn's firm appeared to be part of a Turkish government smear campaign against the cleric. ""This is just another example of the Turkish government spending significant amounts of taxpayer dollars to spread falsehoods and persecute any critics without evidence of wrongdoing,"" it said in a statement. The lobbying registration didn't say how much Flynn's company was being paid, and Kelley said he didn't know. It's the first-ever lobbying registration for Flynn Intel Group, which the general founded after leaving government in 2014. The routing of a government-linked lobbying effort through a European organization smacks of the lobbying scandal that helped bring down Paul Manafort as Trump's campaign chairman this summer. The Associated Press revealed that Manafort, as an adviser to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, coordinated U.S. lobbying through a Brussels-based think tank. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is widely considered a contender for defense secretary or national security adviser. The former role would require a congressional waiver because he has not yet been a civilian for seven years. Flynn has ruffled national security circles by appearing on Russian state-fund television and accompanying Trump to classified briefings. Nahal Toosi contributed reporting. "

But he's still ready for more. ""If Bruce called today and said, 'We're going to do another six months,' I would have let out a yell of exultation,"" Weinberg says. ""I'd be happy to do it. I don't have anything to work out to where I'd say, 'Well, I gotta think about that. …'"" We spoke to Weinberg about the long tour, how he endures four-hour concerts at age 65, the frightening health ordeals he dealt with in recent years, his son Jay's tenure in Slipknot and why he'd play drums for Bruce for free. The River Tour was somewhat last minute, right? Yeah. Bruce first called right after Halloween of 2015 and said he had an idea. We knew about the  River box set coming out. He called and said, ""I'm thinking about promoting it a little bit and playing some."" I was like, ""Sure, great."" That turned into 89 concerts. That's basically how we've kind of worked over the past 40 or year so. Plan on 15 concerts or 30, but once we get out there, it's never 15 or 30. It's a lot more. Playing The River was a tremendous amount of fun. It was challenging. One of the things I liked about it, and I think everyone felt the same, when you play something night after night you really get to dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist. My job as the drummer is to advance the story. Even now, after playing those songs for 40 years, I'm still finding ways to leave things out, which is really the aim as I've gotten older. Look, I'll be 66 next month, and it's nice to say I'm still figuring out ways to play this great canon of material in a different fashion. I sometimes look at you near the end of the show and think, ""How does Max still have the energy to keep playing like this?"" Well, I appreciate the sentiment. I don't really get tired. It's a funny thing. I can use a sports analogy. I've met a couple of the Chicago Bulls and one of the things they invariably say is that when you're playing with Michael Jordan it's a completely unique experience than playing with someone else. He lifts everyone else's game. That's really what it is with Bruce. I do plenty of other musical jobs on my own, which are fun and rewarding, whether it's playing [with] a 15-piece orchestra or playing with a rock and soul band. But playing at that level, I don't get tired. My body has adapted through the years, whether I had heart surgery or cancer surgery or hand surgery, my body, my doctors have realized, has adapted to the stress of having to do that for four hours. I'll tell you one of the things we've been talking about lately, how fortunate we are to be this age, all of us in the band, and Bruce as well, is being able to bring it night after night with the level of quality that we do. I think I see it in the faces of the people who are watching us, the commitment of striving to excellence night after night. That's something we're all extremely proud of. Nobody is phoning it in. That's not in the lexicon. Staying in shape is very important. I do a lot of swimming so my breath is good. Muscle-wise, I'm in shape. That helps a lot playing the drums. ""Nobody is phoning it in,"" Weinberg says. ""That's not in the lexicon."" Sergione Infuso/Corbis/Getty Do you worry that you're going to eventually push your body to the breaking point and that at some point this won't be doable anymore? I don't think about that. I don't play drums the same way I played when I was in my twenties. I don't play with an equal amount of power. It's more power since I developed the amount of finesse that I have. Unless you're physically sick, and I have been. I've had major heart surgery. Major cancer surgery. Major hand surgery. Major back surgery. And I'm here to report that I feel a thousand percent great. I certainly think we're testing the boundaries of what has been done. Certainly there are bands playing that are older than us. The Stones come to mind. I can't think of any that during the course of 14 nights plays 100 different songs. Charlie Watts has a soft touch like a jazz drummer. You bring a lot of power and that's obviously more difficult. Well they're a blues band. Charlie's influences were not rock drummers. They were jazz drummers. I was influenced by jazz drummers, but I'm a rock-era drummer. Our approach has always been very intense, going back 45 years. What you do is you let the drums, and of course today's sophisticated sound systems, monitor systems work for you. That really helps a lot too. You develop the idea of, ""We're gonna play for four hours? We're gonna play for hour hours. We're gonna play for three? OK."" Bruce is the only one who is going to decide when we're going to stop, so I have to be ready to play longer than he can. I realized, even lately, that I don't really get tired. I've got plenty of playing left in me at the end of the night. I think that's from staying in shape, eating right, getting enough sleep and all the physical things any athlete would do. I'm not going to say that every night I'm not... The other night there was a certain bit Bruce was doing where I had to hold this roll. Normally I hold it for 16 bars. It's a very fast single-stroke roll. It was during ""Glory Days."" He held it for like 24 bars and then an additional eight bars. You go to the last note. You don't go [ demonstrates a fast drum roll with his voice ] and then a downbeat. You do it the whole time. I was amazed I was able to get through it and play it and get right to the end. A lot of it is finesse, technique and a lot of willpower. Through the years, that's what you develop is the ability to will yourself through the pain. I shouldn't say pain. ... the discomfort of certain times. Whenever Bruce goes behind you to play to the fans behind the stage, I love watching you turn your head to an almost impossible angle to watch him for a cue. That's the job. That's why I've been here for 43 years. The hardest thing in a band is to get everyone to pay attention. I've been asked through the years to talk about my audition with Bruce. One of the things I noticed after I noticed Bruce is how intently Danny [Federici], Clarence [Clemons] and Garry [Tallent], who were at my first audition, were watching him. That to me really said a lot. I had never been in a band where everyone really paid attention like that. I was 23. It was a long time ago. That really made an impression. One moment that always sticks in my head is that 10-night stand you guys did at MSG in 2000. You could feel the emotion from the stage all over the room. That was amazing. That whole run, I was doing the [Conan O'Brien] show during the day and taking the subway down to the Garden afterwards because it was the quickest way to get down there. We had a little rehearsal room in the bowels of the Garden because Bruce wanted to work on some tunes, which we used several nights. ""Code of Silence"" was one of them. We were rehearsing it 20 minutes before we went onstage in the basement of the Garden. I didn't know they had a space like that. It was a very special tour and everybody had a good time and were happy to be playing together again and bringing it night after night. Of course, Clarence and Danny were in top form on that particular tour. As Clarence got older, and he was the first to admit it, his embouchure, which is the musculature which creates that robust sound, started to give him trouble, and that's the most important thing for a horn player. It's like arthritis for a drummer. But that Live in New York City recording is a really good document of where we were at then. What are your plans now that the River  Tour is done? I never really tour. I do a lot of playing, but it's all for private audiences. Basically trading on my roots as a wedding and bar-mitzvah-band drummer. That's what I do. I go and play weddings and bar mitzvahs, and that's how I came up. I've got a variety of groups that I play with. One is strictly Stax and Motown oriented, 12-piece band. I have a 23-piece 1950s-style dance orchestra. Occasionally, I play with my 15-piece Count Basie/Buddy Rich–style band, playing the kind of music I loved as a kid. I indulge my hobby of real-estate investing quite a bit and spend most of my time now getting off on my son's career more than mine. ""I've seen him up close and I don't know how he does it,"" Max Weinberg says of his son Jay. Joby Sessions/Rhythm Magazine/Getty What's it like watching Jay play in Slipknot? Jay is an unbelievable drummer. Two years in a row he's been named the best metal drummer out there. They have very dedicated fans and their music is intense, and I like intense music. It's complicated. I couldn't do it. I've seen him up close and I don't know how he does it. I had nothing to to do with it. He taught himself. He'll be 27 this year and he's just a killer drummer and a great kid. It's so much fun for me to see him play, and he's a virtual artist. He lives in Nashville. He's doing quite a bit of stuff. He's writing songs on his own and the band is making plans to do another record, a follow-up to the last one, which did very well. Do you stand in the audience at the Slipknot shows? It gets pretty intense. I don't go up front. I won't go up front since I'd get knocked around. I watch on the side of the stage or at the board. The drums and the vocals are the loudest things in the mix and the way he plays double bass, he's got one of those drum sets and uses all of it. That's been very pleasing for me. The other night we got an audible for ""Radio Nowhere"" and I never play that song without thinking of Jay because everyone says that Jay just kicked my ass on that song and played it so much better than I did. I stole a lot of the licks he used on that song. You mentioned a cancer surgery. What sort of cancer and when was that? I had prostate cancer. I'm someone that's always very proactive about my health. I was diagnosed in June of 2011, literally two days after Clarence's passing, and had surgery. I'm one of the lucky ones. I asked my doctor, ""Did we catch it early?"" He said, ""Well, not terribly early."" I had some definite thoughts on the state of surgery in general, prostate surgery specifically, but most people know I had this major open-heart surgery in 2010 that saved my life. Why did you have the heart surgery? I was in heart failure. If I didn't do it then there was a real good chance I'd be the guy that didn't wake up one day. It was a timing thing. I was first diagnosed with this heart defect back when I was in my thirties. There wasn't a lot you could do it for, so it was a watch-and-wait thing. I found a fantastic doctor,  David Adams at Mt. Sinai , and he actually removed my heart and did plastic surgery of the heart. That was a big one. That was a 13-hour operation and six months recovery. I'll tell you what, those brushes with … getting that close … when I play with Bruce and the E Street Band now … it was always fun, but I can't believe I'm so lucky to be doing this, that I'm alive to be doing this. I'll be 66 in three weeks and I'm alive to be doing this. After those surgeries did you worry you'd never play drums again? The heart surgery was so invasive I didn't think I would get better at first. That's how far down it pushes you on your ass. It was a massively invasive heart surgery. This isn't like bypass surgery. I'm not minimizing bypass surgery, but that's like getting a cavity filled next to this. This was intense and it took me six months to get my strength back. I lost 50 pounds. It was a life-changing experience. The fans had no idea. They just saw you on the next tour and you looked fine. That was in 2010. We didn't play again until 2012. I took the big band on the road and spent several months doing that. Then I had the cancer diagnosis right after Clarence's last week. I had the surgery on July 26th. That's an invasive operation, but fortunately I had a great outcome and within a month or so I was ready to rock. I don't think we went on tour until the next year anyway. I come from strong stock. I come from strong Russian people. The nickname ""Mighty"" I guess is apt. I just push and push and push. If I can make it up to the drums, I'm going to play my hardest and do the best I can. ""I can't believe I'm so lucky to be doing this, that I'm alive to be doing this,"" Weinberg says. Matthew Peyton/Getty It's crazy that you never quite know when Bruce will call and say he wants to go on tour in a few months. There's a little myth about this. I get a little more inside knowledge. With the River Tour, it's just [that] he had this box set. I don't think he necessarily was planning to go out and play. I had a bunch of dates booked. So did Nils [Lofgren]. He had a whole tour. Of course, nobody is going to not do it. If he wants to do something, you do it. There's nothing more important than playing in Bruce and the E Street Band, so you work it out. It's a little more organized than that. There's a lot of logistics. He's got 100 different crew members. The River Tour was a blessing. They're all a blessing, but that came about pretty radically. ... I heard he was going to do something else, maybe something by himself, and then he decided it would be a fun thing to do. Any idea what's coming next? No idea. I have no idea. I don't even think about it. I really don't. For me, we played the last night in Auckland. I hope we play again, but I don't plan my life around playing again. I do what I do. So far, it's seemed to work out. It's up to Bruce, and if everyone can physically do it then you do it. So far, so good. I don't think anyone walks away from any of these shows we did in the last six weeks and thinks, ""Guys, it's time to hang it up."" I think we're breaking new ground. I think we're like the old bluesmen that just keep playing. What else are you going to do? Whatever leads up to playing the drums is life. When I'm seated there playing the drums, I'm 14 years old. For me, the reward is I feel like I'm 14, but I have the experience of someone that's been doing for this 60 years. That's a rare combination. I'm very, very lucky. I look around, I see the band, and they inspire me every night. Bruce is standing right in front of me, or he comes up and says something while he gets a drink of water and that inspires me. I hope we do something again. I have no crystal ball. It's quite a miracle that at age 23 you happened to respond to a Village Voice ad that changed your life to such a profound degree. I've thought about that a lot. What if I hadn't answered that ad? But now 43 years later I've realized, I was the guy. I was destined to get the job because of my background, and so was Roy [Bittan]. The thing we brought was what he needed and what the band needed at the time. But what would have happened to my life had I not met Bruce and the E Street Band? What would have happened to the Beatles had they not gotten Ringo? What would have happened had they stuck with Pete Best? He was a very, very good drummer. But as I think as he himself has said, Ringo was a much better Beatle. Chemistry is everything. I can't imagine ""Badlands"" without you on it. It would be like a different song. I appreciate that. Listen, that record, and a lot of the early ones, were struggles to make. We weren't some polished studio band that was just in for another three-hour session. This was our lives. We grew up on record, all of us. Some of us were more advanced than others. I don't include myself among them that were more advanced, but I tried my best. I played with passion. I tried to play with invention. It was a ballsy thing to play a single stroll roll through the entirety of ""Candy's Room."" A studio drummer would not have done that. It would have gotten you fired right away. But I did that and it was like, ""That's cool. Do that again."" I have tapes where its called ""The Fast Song."" It didn't have a name. The originally song was slower. Through my TV career I've played with more musicians than anyone in the E Street Band, great people. There's still nothing I'd rather do than play ""Badlands"" or ""Darkness on the Edge of Town."" We played that the other night and it was so heavy. It was an audible. You have to learn to read Bruce's lips onstage. I'm a pretty good lip reader and I saw ""Darkness."" It also could have been something else. All I heard was the first two notes where I don't play and I knew what song it was. As soon as he hit that, I was there. That's the kind of thing you get from constant working at it for 40 plus years. Without sounding hackneyed, it's been the privilege and the pleasure of my life to play with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. I came back two days ago and I'm still pretty jet-lagged, but I feel the same way I felt the night after my first audition where I was playing a Broadway show. I was living with my parents, going to college, playing club dates. I was in a variety of bands, and I didn't know Bruce or anything about his scene. But I went up to him and said, ""I don't know who you are going to choose, but I'll tell you what, I'll play with you for nothing."" And that sentiment is still in force today. Of course, there's a practical side of life that everyone has to address. But when I'm on tour and people come up and tell you what the music has meant to them, it's just … I'd still do it for nothing. It's unique. It's just unique. There's nothing like it.  "
8.400241665606492e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:19:02 +0000 2017	"The House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare is quickly becoming a bill that nobody wants to own. Since its introduction this week, legislation from top House Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act has drawn a flood of opposition from lawmakers and a range of health care leaders and industry stakeholders, including major doctors and hospital groups. While the bill's writers and the White House confidently insist that the plan will pass, they have been far less eager to put their names on it. GOP Rep. Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and a key author of the Obamacare bill along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Greg Walden, smiled and paused Thursday afternoon when asked by CNN about the nicknames ""Trumpcare"" and ""Ryancare."" When another reporter suggested ""Bradycare,"" the congressman chuckled and joked: ""You know, you'll never get invited back to this, OK?"" ""I don't care what it's called -- I just want to give Americans affordable health care that they choose,"" Brady said before walking away. Earlier in the week, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway resisted calling the bill ""Trumpcare."" ""I didn't hear President Trump say to any of us, 'Hey, I want my name on that,'"" Conway said on Fox News. ""This is serious stuff. It's not about branding according to someone's name."" Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price suggested an alternative. ""I prefer to call it Patient Care. This is about patients, at the end of the day,"" the former congressman and physician told reporters at the White House this week. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to Trump, told CNN that the White House is ""exactly right"" to reject the name ""Trumpcare."" ""The minute you call it by a politician's name, it becomes vulnerable. ... If it refers to you, then they oppose the bill,"" Gingrich said. ""What they want to do is find a way to get something out in the open where you're arguing over the ideas and not the personalities."" When former President Barack Obama began to craft a major health care overhaul legislation soon after taking the office, Republicans and critics began negatively referring to the bill as ""Obamacare,"" a name that has stuck to this day. (Obama eventually came around to the nickname, saying: ""I do care""). The widespread wariness about having the Obamacare repeal bill named after any one person in the party comes amid mounting criticism of the legislation. It's a clear sign of the grave political ramifications of the GOP efforts to overhaul a health care system that has provided coverage to some 20 million people -- and how much will be at stake in upcoming elections if Republicans' plan leads to millions of people losing their insurance. Similarly, critics of the new GOP legislation are determined to make names like ""Trumpcare"" and ""Ryancare"" stick. The conservative Club for Growth released a statement this week opposing the GOP bill and referring to it as ""Ryancare,"" while Democratic lawmakers have long since taken to calling it ""Trumpcare."" ""Trumpcare, simply put, is a mess that gives you less for more. And Trumpcare doesn't discriminate against which Americans it hurts,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday. ""Trumpcare means higher costs and less coverage. Are you a woman? Trumpcare means higher costs and less coverage."" Bill moving forward quickly, but not without opposition The House bill has met fierce resistance from conservatives in the lower chamber. They are urging the party to take a vote on a ""clean repeal"" bill rather than attempt to include replacement measures in one package. After sessions that totaled 45 hours Wednesday and Thursday, two House committees approved the Ryan-led bill, and the House Budget panel is expected to take it up next week. But Monday, the Congressional Budget Office is set to deliver its report, which is likely to show the bill will cut health insurances from millions of people. And even if the legislation makes it through the House, its prospects are shaky in the Senate,-- where Republicans have a razor-thin majority. GOP Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted Thursday morning: ""House health-care bill can't pass Senate w/o major changes. To my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don't get it fast."" Sen. John Thune told CNN that there are ""lots of ways to fix and amend"" the House bill in the Senate. ""I just think you have to have an opportunity for members of the Senate to have their input,"" Thune said. Sen. John McCain, who has long urged his fellow GOP colleagues to take things slow on health care reform, said this week that the two chambers are fundamentally different. ""I think (the House Obamacare bill) is a good blueprint but we have a lot of examination to do,"" McCain said. ""And that's why we're the Senate and they're the House."" "
8.400228091160453e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:13:39 +0000 2017	"Downtown Wilmington, Ohio, on Jan. 19, the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration. The rural town in southwestern Ohio voted overwhelmingly for Trump. (Andrew Spear for The Washington Post) WILMINGTON, Ohio — Thousands of miles from here, the Kremlin is denying accusations that it meddled in the U.S. presidential election. But in this town of rolling farmland and main streets shaded by grain elevators, the barrage of news coming out about the Trump administration’s ties to Russia has fallen on mostly indifferent ears. “The Russia thing doesn’t fit too well here,” Harold Rowland said in between bites of his breakfast at McDonald’s. “Nobody really cares.” Rowland, 75, comes almost every morning to this McDonald’s on the outskirts of town to sit and talk with three other Wilmington residents who have formed an informal breakfast club. [ Feeling forgotten by Obama, people in this Ohio town look to Trump with cautious hope ] They’ve only discussed Russia once in recent weeks — when former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned over revelations about his potentially illegal contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “He was out of bounds for sure,” said Rowland, who last voted for a Democrat in 1964. Wayne Smith, 74, said he’s skeptical about all the stories of ties between President Trump’s associates and Russia. “Is there something there? Probably,” said Smith, who walks with a cane and stands up about every 10 minutes to relieve the pressure on his back, a lingering reminder of his half-century working as a barber before he retired. “But Judas Priest, don’t go overboard.” Smith said he thinks the media and Democrats have “made a mountain out of a molehill” and killed off any chance for a rational discussion. When he watched Trump’s joint address to Congress last week, he felt buoyed by it. “I saw 72 percent approved or something like that,” said Smith, likely alluding to a joint CNN/ORC poll following the speech that reported that about 7 in 10 who tuned in were more optimistic about the direction of the country. “It’s a start, but I wish he was more upright, more presidential,” Smith said, smiling. “But you know, he still speaks our language … the language of the country boy.” Tom Speer, 70, seemed more perturbed by the news on Russia. “Do I think it affected the outcome of the election?” Speer said. “No, but they have no business meddling in ours.” As for Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador, Speer said the retired lieutenant general had just “put the cart before the horse.” The four men at the table said they are pleased with how Trump is running the country and remain optimistic, no matter the news coming out of Washington. “Trump is doing great,” Speer said. “He’s not God or Superman, but he’s done what he could with his executive orders.” From left: Boyd Lamb, Wayne Smith, Harold Rowland and Tom Speer enjoy breakfast on March 1. (Thomas Gibbons-Neff/The Washington Post) Since the election and Trump’s inauguration, the town has been more focused on local issues. In early February, retail giant Amazon.com decided to pull a burgeoning shipping hub and plans for as many as 3,000 new jobs at Wilmington’s airpark, opting instead to take a $10 million dollar tax break to relocate to Kentucky. That news dashed hopes that the town would be able to pump new life into its economy soon. (Amazon’s founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) At a coffee shop six miles away and closer into town, Emma Heyo, 20, said the Russia news had barely crossed her radar, appearing only sporadically on her social media feeds. “Russia stuff? I really don’t know much about it,” said Heyo, a part-time barista who is studying medical massage in nearby Dayton. “We’re friendly with Putin, right? And friends are better than enemies. “To be honest, politics is something I try and avoid,” she added. Mostly white and with a population of roughly 12,000 people, Wilmington’s surrounding county of Clinton has gone Republican in every presidential race since 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson was elected. In November, it cast more votes for Trump than any other Republican candidate in the county’s history. In another first, more than 70 percent of Wilmington’s eligible voting population came out to the polls. Yet there is a small core of residents who are less enamored of Trump. The Page Turners’ Book Club, which meets once a month in the basement of Wilmington’s library, had just finished their discussion of the 2016 bestseller “ The Nest ” by Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney before talking about a recent piece in the New Yorker titled “ Trump, Putin, and the New Cold War .” “Our hair’s on fire, and this stuff can’t come out fast enough,” said Mary Thomas Watts about the flood of news about Russia and Trump. A former journalist from Mississippi, Watts sits on the board of the library, leads the Page Turners’ discussion and usually helps organize the weekly progressive happy hour at the General Denver Hotel in town. After learning that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had potentially misled Congress by saying he did not have contact with the Russians during Trump’s campaign, the group of six women and one man was incensed. “They all have got to go,” Watts said. Watts attended the Women’s March on Washington, while others in the group participated in a smaller march at Wilmington’s courthouse the same day. “Just imagine this group all in pink hats,” Watts said. Progressive Happy Hour at the General Denver Hotel in Wilmington, Ohio, on March 2. (Thomas Gibbons-Neff/The Washington Post) The small group and their liberal leanings are a rarity in Wilmington, a fact they’ve become acutely aware of as the town turned out in droves for Trump. Julie Butcher, member of the book club and an employee at a local insurance company, said that her 14-year-old daughter has “Trump!” yelled in her face regularly at school after she admitted to voting for Hillary Clinton during a mock election in the fall. “You can’t say anything, and you can’t post anything because you just get attacked,” Butcher said. This piece has been updated to reflect that Lyndon B. Johnson was elected in 1964, not 1962 and that the Pageturners book club meets once a month, not once a week.  Read more: They were sure Trump would be the next president Why many veterans are sticking with Trump, even after he insulted a Gold Star family "
8.400207304315699e+17	Fri Mar 10 02:05:23 +0000 2017	"NEW YORK (AP) — Before most people are out of bed, Donald Trump is watching cable news. With Twitter app at the ready, the man who condemns the media as ""the enemy of the people"" may be the most voracious consumer of news in modern presidential history. Trump usually rises before 6 a.m. and first watches TV in the residence before later moving to a small dining room in the West Wing. A short time later, he's given a stack of newspapers — including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, The Washington Post and, long his favorite, The New York Post — as well as pile of printed articles from other sources including conservative online outlets like Breitbart News. The TVs stay on all day. The president often checks in at lunch and again in the evening, when he retires to the residence, cellphone in hand. It is a central paradox of the Trump presidency. Despite his fervent media criticism, Trump is a faithful newspaper reader who enjoys jousting with reporters, an avid cable TV news viewer who frequently live-tweets what he's watching, and a reader of websites that have been illuminated by his presidential spotlight, showcasing the at-times conspiratorial corners of the internet. No recent president has been so public about his interest in his media coverage, nor seemed so willing to mobilize the powers of the federal government based on a media report that he has just read, heard or watched. In fact, the power of Trump's media diet is so potent that White House staffers have, to varying degrees of success, tried to limit his television watching and control some of what he reads. The president's cable TV menu fluctuates. Fox News is a constant, and he also frequently watches CNN despite deriding it as ""fake news."" Though he used to watch ""Morning Joe,"" a Trump aide said the president has grown frustrated with his coverage on the MSNBC program and has largely stopped. For Trump, watching cable is often an interactive experience. More than dozen times since his election, he has tweeted about what he saw on TV just minutes before. On Nov. 29, he posted about instituting potentially unconstitutional penalties for burning the American flag 30 minutes after Fox ran a segment on the subject. On Jan. 24, he threatened to ""send in the Feds!"" to Chicago a short time after watching a CNN segment on violence in the city. On Feb. 6, after CNN reported about a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit on the increasing power of the president's advisers, Trump just 11 minutes later tweeted, ""I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it!"" On Tuesday, Trump tweeted five different times about the news of the day being discussed on his preferred morning show, ""Fox & Friends."" MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, a frequent Trump critic, told The Associated Press that she finds it ""unsettling"" that Trump ""may be getting most of his understanding of the world based on whatever he stumbles upon on cable."" While pleased that Trump is following the media, Maddow noted that ""the White House is designed as an instrument to feed the president of the United States expertly curated and highly selective, well-vetted information from every corner of the world."" Others note the president is there may be some smart politics behind Trump's media diet. He ""advertised getting his news the same way his supporters do, which helps make a connection,"" said Tobe Berkovitz, a communications professor at Boston University. The president's advisers try to curb his cable consumption during the workday. But there are no limits when he returns to the residence. He also avidly watches his own staff's TV performances, including White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's daily briefing. Aides have been known to shape their public comments to please the president or try to influence him. Trump's consumption of cable news differs considerably from previous commanders in chief, who have at least claimed to be disconnected from the cable chatter. Jay Carney, White House press secretary under Barack Obama, has claimed that Obama ""doesn't watch cable news,"" though that did not keep the former president from criticizing the medium. Where Trump differs most from his presidential predecessors is his reliance on getting news online — even though he rarely uses a computer and prefers aides to print out articles for him to read. What he was seeing on Twitter and conservative websites like the Drudge Report and the conspiracy-laden Infowars helped forge his political persona — and his public misinformation campaign questioning whether Obama was born in the United States. And social media has become a way for some news sources to gain an audience with the president. Last Thursday, as questions swirled around contacts between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Russian ambassador, a Reddit user posted a picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin and New York Sen. Charles Schumer from a 2003 photo op. Two hours later, the blog The Gateway Pundit reprinted the photo with the headline ""Where's the Outrage?"" The image careened across the internet from an Infowars editor's post to the Drudge Report to Trump's own Twitter account as he delivered that outrage, demanding an investigation into Schumer's alleged ties to Putin. That wasn't the only time last week when Trump put the White House stamp on a theory that originated on the edges of the conservative movement. Radio host Mark Levin voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. That accusation was picked up the next day by Breitbart News, the site formerly run by Trump's current chief strategist Steve Bannon. An aide placed that piece in Trump's daily reading pile, said a White House official, who like other aides would not be named discussing the president's private routine. Fueled by that report on Saturday, Trump unleashed a series of jaw-dropping tweets that accused his predecessor of spying on him. ""It's not the normal Beltway echo chamber. This is a very different echo chamber: Something will bounce from cable to the internet to Trump,"" said Berkovitz, the communications professor. The president's clip file is assembled by junior aides, though senior staffers occasionally slip in an article they want him to see. Often he'll sit with staff and use a Sharpie marker to scrawl instructions — or complaints to push back on — on the pages. ___ Additional reporting by David Bauder in New York and Julie Pace in Washington. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire "
8.400189763023462e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:58:25 +0000 2017	"It’s time to put an end to the myth that Republicans believe in fiscal responsibility. Saving taxpayer dollars takes a back seat to the ideological imperative of blaming and shaming the poor. Witness the GOP’s long-awaited plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. House committees are moving forward on the legislation before the Congressional Budget Office has even had a chance to estimate how much the measure will cost. Why the rush? Because if the plan doesn’t snatch away health insurance coverage from millions of people — and both President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) swear it won’t — then it’s surely going to cost a ton. The Republican plan would take away the ACA’s subsidies and replace them with refundable tax credits based on age for incomes up to $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 for a married couple. This means a windfall for those who are older and well-to-do. In essence, the plan would expand government assistance to encompass many who don’t really need it — in order to avoid targeting help toward those who do. The GOP plan would also eliminate the ACA’s penalty fee for not having health insurance, which goes into the public till — and replace it with a different penalty fee that goes to the insurance companies. Apparently Republicans have no problem committing what they once called “extortion” if the benefit goes to private companies, not the common good. Keep in mind that Trump and GOP leaders in Congress promise that after dealing with health care they will seek huge tax cuts, including for the wealthy. As fiscal policy, how does this make sense? It doesn’t. It only makes sense as ideology. In today’s Republican Party, policies have to satisfy the belief that the less fortunate are poor by choice. Rarely do Republicans just come out and accuse the poor of being lazy freeloaders, but Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) came close. He suggested that “rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.” The priciest iPhone advertised on Apple’s website is a 7 Plus model with 256 gigabytes of storage and all the bells and whistles. It costs $969. If Chaffetz will cancel his health insurance plan, I will write him a check for that amount — and wish him the best of luck providing health care for his family. Maybe he’ll be able to pay for a single visit to the emergency room. It would be one thing if the GOP’s mean-spirited ideology actually saved money, but it doesn’t. Quite the contrary, in fact. When you ask Republicans what they’re going to cut, they mention foreign aid — which totals about $35 billion , or slightly less than 1 percent of federal spending. They threaten to eviscerate smaller agencies by cutting $6 billion here or $8 billion there — but at the same time, they applaud Trump’s pledge to increase the nearly $600 billion defense budget by an incredible 10 percent . They’re going to end up spending more — perhaps lots more — and collecting less in tax revenue. And this is the party that claims to care about deficits and debt? But wait, Republicans say, we’re going to “save” the big entitlement programs by trimming benefits. Yeah, sure. I’m not holding my breath. The problem is that Medicare and Social Security serve middle-class and upper-crust taxpayers, including many who share the GOP’s punish-the-poor belief system. If you think these ACA-focused town halls are hostile , just you wait. The fact is that among recent administrations, at least, Democratic presidents have been the relative skinflints. Bill Clinton, you will recall, actually balanced the budget — and yes, he had help from Republicans in Congress. Barack Obama spent heavily at first to save the economy, which was teetering on the edge of a dreadful abyss, but he ended up slashing the deficit in half and presiding over years of uninterrupted economic growth. George W. Bush, on the other hand, fought hugely expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq without accounting for them in his budgets. He also convinced Congress to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs, which was compassionate but costly. Trump promises to be even more of a big spender. Among other things, he promises a trillion-dollar program to renew the nation’s infrastructure. Imagine the Republican howling if Obama had suggested such a thing. The GOP will surely persist in its sanctimony about balanced budgets, but no one should pay any attention. Republicans, we see what you’re doing.

8.400182161728061e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:55:24 +0000 2017	"Six people on skis took part in the inaugural expedition on a 120km route despite snow and freezing conditions. Picture: Tomsk.ru A group of intrepid trekkers walked across the heart of Siberia's world-famous Vasyugan Mire as part of a project to bring winter eco-tourism to the swamp. Organised by the Tomsk branch of the Russian Geographical Society, six people on skis took part in the inaugural expedition on a 120km route despite snow and freezing conditions. The aim was to plough a way through the area for visitors to follow and conduct a comprehensive study of the swamp’s ecosystem along the way. Located in western Siberia, and 53,000km sq in size, Vasyugan Mire is the largest swamp in the northern hemisphere and is home to a range of unique flora and fauna. Afterwards the expedition was heralded a success, with the hope it can now become a new area of interest for tourists from Russia and overseas. Danil Barashkov, a 25-year-old biologist from Tomsk who took part in the trip, said it had been a 'great adventure'. 'There were lots of interesting things,' he said. 'I remember a chance encounter with wood grouse that jumped in front of us on the path and flew away. It is a very large and very beautiful bird and meeting it was success. 'Most of all I remember the stunning sunsets. They were an indescribable sight: the play of light, clouds, the tops of miniature pine trees and snow expanses merged into a single breath-taking picture.' Ioann Chechnev, 22 yo Tomsk based organizer of the expedition and his team. Pictures: Danil Barashkov Formed 10,000 years ago, the swamp is a major reservoir of fresh water for the region and is home to a number of endangered species, including the white-tailed eagle and fish hawk. It is so large it occupies about two per cent of the whole area of the world's peat bogs. The expedition was supported by the Professional Expeditions tourist centre and it is hoped the idea of winter treks will prove popular with people interested in wildlife. As well as Mr Barashkov, the group comprised of organiser Ioann Chechnev, Svetlana Pakhomenko, cameraman Alexey Myakishev, tourism instructor Anton Ruchkin, and Yuriy Terekhin. The trek started on February 14, from the village Orlovka, on the border of Novosibirsk and Tomsk regions. The team finished on February 22, when they arrived in Krutikha village. Deep snow slowed the group down at times, and they were forced to cope with the elements – sleeping in tents at night as temperatures dropped to -40C. They also carried heavy backpacks weighing up to 30kg and allowing them to be completely self-sufficient. 'As a rule, in such circumstances you need to become laidback to some extent. And you can’t have a sense of fear in such an expeditions.' Pictures: Danil Barashkov Mr Chechnev said: 'The first hours were the most difficult because when you wake up in -35C, it is necessary to make a fire and cook breakfast. We woke up mostly at 6 am.' The only female participant, Svetlana Pakhomenko, was more enthusiastic, however. 'I felt a real sense of infinity,' she said. 'Everywhere we went there was a fantastic sun. Never have I seen such a beautiful setting sun. It gave us a cosmic feeling!' A documentary shot during the week-long trip will be available later this year. While one of the aims was to entice more visitors to the mire, Mr Barashkov said he took part for purely scientific reasons. An Associate in the Laboratory of biogeochemical and remote methods of environmental monitoring (BIO-GEO-CLIM) at Tomsk State University, he took samples along the route. He said: 'There were various types of samples, to measure the content of methane, carbon, and other gases. This will be the starting point for further research. The content of the gas can say what the climate was before and how it can change later, but to make such a prediction we need to have more information. This is just one step on the long road. 'It was very hard psychologically to get out of the sleeping bag in the morning because of the cold.' Pictures: Danil Barashkov 'One of the most difficult tasks for me was taking the samples themselves. To take a probe of water for methane content it had to be filtered with a syringe, and at -35C it turned into ice almost instantly.' And of the expedition itself he said: 'It was very hard psychologically to get out of the sleeping bag in the morning because of the cold. We had ordinary tents and the temperature inside them was almost equal to the temperature outside.' He added: 'That said, even at a temperature of -35C it was warm [when walking] under the weight of the backpack. But after 10 minutes, during stops, we felt cold again. At such moments, you really understand the statement: 'While you are moving, you are alive.' 'Never have I seen such a beautiful setting sun. It gave us a cosmic feeling!'. Pictures: Danil Barashkov There are many ghostly stories about mythical happenings on the Vasyugan Swamp, but the team was philosophical about the possibility of meeting odd creatures. 'As a rule, in such circumstances you need to become laidback to some extent,' said Barashkov. 'And you can’t have a sense of fear in such an expeditions. The imagination loves to play with a person, and if you give it a reason to, you can see a lot of silhouettes of people or human-like creatures, especially in the evening at dusk. 'Still, we never saw anything supernatural – except the indescribable beauty of the sunsets.' "
8.400167793510769e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:49:41 +0000 2017	"Federal agents are not the only ones trying to remove people from the Buffalo area who have entered the country illegally. If Bill Bing, a carpenters union official, discovers workers at local construction projects suspected of being in the country illegally, the union tips off authorities. That information has led to some raids and arrests, he said, although the detention last month of 32 individuals suspected of being in the country illegally and working at projects was not his tip. ""We were not directly responsible for the information on those two raids,"" said Bing, the local representative for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters. Bing said he is  glad to see the enforcement of immigration laws and makes no apologies for when he or other union members tip off federal and state authorities. The jobs should go to American citizens and that it is not a union-versus-nonunion issue, he said. Local police weigh bigger role in immigration crackdown ""There are very good local union and nonunion contractors who suffer the fallout from dirty business,"" Bing said. ""This directly affects area living standards, not to mention the tax dollars New York State, Erie County and the local municipalities don't and won't see."" Other trade unions, he said, tip off authorities, ""but they are not as proactive as we are. The carpenters union devotes a lot of money and resources to this."" But even as the unions supply tips, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say there have been numerous false reports of federal officers conducting law enforcement actions against immigrants. ""Reports of ICE checkpoints and sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible,"" said Khaalid H. Walls, an ICE spokesman. ""These reports create mass panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger,"" Walls said. ""Any groups falsely reporting such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support."" Subcontractors blamed Developers say they want only workers who are legally in the country at their construction sites but sometimes they lose control of who is showing up for work. Take for instance the hotel conversion of the long-abandoned Dunlop Tire Corp. headquarters on, an eyesore for decades off the I-190 near the north Grand Island bridges. Jayesh Patel, the owner, said he does not condone the use of undocumented workers at that site, But nine construction workers there were detained by Border Patrol agents Feb. 15 and charged with immigration violations. Patel's company, Rudra Management & Rosewood Hotels, had hired TG Interiors & Drywall Inc, a contractor in the suburbs of Dallas, which brought in the undocumented immigrants. Six telephone calls and messages left at TG Interiors seeking comment were not returned. Patel said it was his understanding that the workers had proper documentation. Given what happened, he said it is unlikely he will hire the Texas contractor for future jobs. ""We don't take the system lightly, and we don't deviate,"" Patel said. George LaBarbara, Patel's superintendent in charge of the $8 million hotel project, now regularly checks that all workers at the site have proper documentation to work in the United States. ""We're not required to do it, but we are,"" Patel said, adding that he encourages subcontractors to hire local residents to work on his projects. Of the 23 workers detained on Feb. 13 at a convenience food store just down the road from a sprawling apartment construction site on the 4800 block of Hamburg's Southwestern Boulevard, seven ended up charged with either felony re-entry after being previously deported or immigration violations, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Those  workers were employed by subcontractors who were hired by yet another subcontractor, Bing said. DGA Builders of Pittsford, the general contractor at Clifton Heights, declined to comment when contacted by The Buffalo News. But a construction worker at the site told The News that worker documents are now being carefully reviewed. Economy affected And it is not only unions who tip off ICE and the Border Patrol, according to Amherst immigration lawyer Michael B. Berger. Construction contractors  provide information to federal authorities if they believe a competitor has gained an unfair advantage by employing less expensive undocumented immigrants, he said. ""This especially happens in roofing and siding work often performed by undocumented workers and certainly unions and construction companies that rely on union workers see it as an unfair disadvantage,"" Berger said. ""I've had clients tell me that they were arrested because of tips from other contractors."" Berger, an immigration lawyer of 40 years, said the Trump administration's focus on enforcement of immigration laws could harm the local economy. ""There has to be a safety valve to prevent overreaction to remove illegal aliens from this country without consideration to the consequences of the local economy,"" he said, pointing out that Western New York farmers are often unable to hire Americans. ""So they rely very heavily on undocumented workers,"" he said. "
8.400162205187318e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:47:28 +0000 2017	"President Trump and many of his top aides have expressed skepticism about climate change, while others say human activity is to blame for global warming. So what's the administration's real position? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) This story has been updated. Scott Pruitt, the nation’s top environmental official, strongly rejected the established science of climate change on Thursday, outraging scientists, environmentalists, and even his immediate predecessor at the Environmental Protection Agency. “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” Pruitt, the newly installed EPA administrator, said on the CNBC program “Squawk Box.” “But we don’t know that yet,” he continued. “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” His comments represented a startling statement for an official so high in the U.S. government, putting him at odds not only with other countries around the globe but also with the official scientific findings of the agency he now leads. President Trump in the past has called the notion of human-fueled climate change a hoax. And other cabinet members, including Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, have previously questioned the scientific basis for combating global warming. [ This climate lawsuit could change everything. No wonder the Trump administration doesn’t want it going to trial ] But Pruitt’s attempt to sow scientific doubt where little exists alarmed environmental advocates, scientists and former EPA officials, who fear he plans to use such views to attack Obama-era regulations aimed at reining in pollution from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. “The world of science is about empirical evidence, not beliefs,” Gina McCarthy, the EPA’s most recent administrator, said in a statement. “When it comes to climate change, the evidence is robust and overwhelmingly clear that the cost of inaction is unacceptably high. Preventing the greatest consequences of climate change is imperative to the health and well-being of all of us who call Earth home.” She added, “I cannot imagine what additional information the Administrator might want from scientists for him to understand that.” [ Proposed NOAA cuts would disarm our coasts in the face of rising seas, scientists say ] Pruitt’s climate change comments resulted in instant headlines on Thursday. As criticism mounted, White House press secretary Sean Spicer batted back a question about Pruitt’s comments from a reporter who cited Pruitt’s words and how they contradict the scientific consensus on climate change. “That’s a snippet of what Administrator Pruitt said,” said Spicer. “He went on and said I don’t think we know conclusively, this is what we know. I would suggest that you touch base with the EPA on that. But he had a very lengthy response and that is just one snippet of what the Administrator said.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer downplayed EPA head Scott Pruitt's comments on March 9 that carbon dioxide isn't a primary contributor to global warming. (The Washington Post) But Pruitt, who was visiting the energy industry conference CERAWeek in Houston, also waded into related controversial topics during his CNBC interview. In particular, he questioned whether it was EPA’s role to regulate carbon dioxide emissions — something undertaken through the agency’s Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s most significant policy to combat climate change — and challenged the Paris agreement on climate change. “Nowhere in the equation has Congress spoken,” said Pruitt on whether his agency is obligated to regulate carbon dioxide. “The legislative branch has not addressed this issue at all. It’s a very fundamental question to say, ‘Are the tools in the toolbox available to the EPA to address this issue of CO2, as the court had recognized in 2007, with it being a pollutant?’” (Pruitt was apparently referring to the 2007 Supreme Court decision in  Massachusetts v. EPA ,  in which the court ruled that “harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized ”  and that the EPA had been “arbitrary and capricious” in failing to issue a determination on whether greenhouse gases endanger the health and welfare of the public.) The remarks appeared to fundamentally call into question whether the EPA has a role in the regulation of greenhouse gases that drive global warming, including not only carbon dioxide but methane. Last week, Pruitt’s agency withdrew an agency request to oil and gas companies to report on their equipment and its methane emissions, which could have laid the groundwork for tighter regulations. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 25 in Oxon Hill, Md. (The Washington Post) Pruitt also dismissed the international Paris climate agreement, which the Obama administration helped to lead and which was joined by nearly 200 countries in late 2015, as a “bad deal” for the United States. “It’s one thing to be talking about CO2 internationally,” Pruitt said. “But when you front-load your costs, as we endeavored to do in that agreement, and then China and India back-loaded their costs for 2030 and beyond, that’s not good for America. That’s not an America first type of approach.” On the science of climate change, Pruitt’s statements fly in the face of an  international scientific consensus , which has concluded that it is “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” For that matter, they also contradict the very website of the agency that Pruitt heads. The EPA’s “Climate Change” website states the following: Recent climate changes, however, cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20 th century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. For this conclusion, the EPA cites the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading global scientific consensus body that assesses the state of the science roughly every five years. Pruitt spoke with CNBC amidst growing anticipation that the Trump administration will soon move to begin a formal rollback of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, an EPA policy capping emissions from electricity generating stations, such as coal-fired power plants. Pruitt himself sued the EPA over the Clean Power Plan in his previous role as the attorney general of Oklahoma. And that’s just one of multiple lawsuits that he filed against the EPA – others were over mercury and air pollution, the agency’s attempts to regulate pollution of waterways, and methane emissions from oil and gas facilities, to name a few. The EPA chief has made several statements in the past that are similar to the present one, perhaps, but not so strongly worded. For instance, writing for National Review in 2016, he stated that “Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.” In his Senate confirmation hearing, meanwhile, he stated in a tense exchange with Senator Bernie Sanders that “the climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner .”  Another of Pruitt’s predecessors — now in the business community — also commented on the science of climate change in the context of his remarks. “The time for debate on climate change has passed,” Lisa Jackson, President Obama’s first EPA administrator and now vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives at Apple, told the Post. “Certainty is what business needs,” said Jackson. “And relying on science is something that we do every single day. So now if we’re going to question science, I think it has an impact on more than just some federal rules, or some law, it has a huge impact on human health, the environment, and our economy.” More from Energy and Environment: White House eyes plan to cut EPA staff by one-fifth, eliminating key programs Humans have caused an explosion of never-before-seen minerals all over the Earth Antarctic ice has set an unexpected record, and scientists are struggling to figure out why For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter   here  and follow us on Twitter   here .

8.400141300231291e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:39:09 +0000 2017	"President Donald Trump is sticking to his comfort zone. Trump has spent each of the 48 nights of his presidency either at the White House or at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. He has dined out in the nation’s capital just once — and that was a trip to his own Trump International Hotel for well-done steak. Story Continued Below Aside from visits to a Florida elementary school and a Boeing plant — both en route to weekend breaks at Mar-a-Lago — he’s stayed within the presidential bubble even when venturing beyond Washington, visiting military installations and speaking at a large campaign-style rally. Trump has shown a willingness to cast off the routine elements of his job — the baby-kissing and glad-handing that his predecessors used to stay in touch with voters. Instead, he relies on Twitter as his megaphone — and on cable television to give him a daily sense of what the public is thinking. Aides say they don't expect Trump to do much retail politicking — he doesn't love shaking hands — but will keep doing large rallies, including one scheduled for next week in Nashville. The rallies were part of his campaign routine that he loved because he was energized by large crowds. On foreign trips, one administration official said, his staff expect him to schedule “just as much time as he needs to be there.” Trump is expected to make several appearances across the country next week — but he is likely to head back to Washington at night. His habits in the White House so far comport with what friends in New York say about his pre-political life. He has long been a creature of comfort, eschewing some of New York's glitzy balls and galas to instead stay at home, watch TV and dine in his apartment, while watching sports and calling friends. After winning the presidency, he largely stayed in his apartment or at Mar-a-Lago, venturing out once in New York to the 21 Club for dinner. He is happy to not go outside. “He's not a guy who likes to be away from his own bed,” said Chris Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend and the CEO of Newsmax, who visited Trump recently at the White House. “He doesn't want to tour or travel for the sake of traveling. If he can get in a round of golf in Scotland, he'll do that. But you're not going to see him just spend three days shopping and visiting friends.” On Tuesday, when public White House tours resumed for the first time since Trump took office, the president surprised a group of schoolchildren by hopping out from behind a screen to greet them. But other than that, he’s spent much of his time with people he already knows. He’s hosted CEOs and other executives at the White House at least 11 times in his 2½- month-old presidency. He’s huddled with the leaders of America’s automotive, pharmaceutical, retail, health insurance, financial and airline giants. Sitting around a large boardroom, while quizzing others round-robin, is a scene he is comfortable with and feels he can control. Part of Trump’s seeming distance from the real world may simply be the result of comparison to recent history and Trump's top aides. According to Washingtonian , President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama went to at least 80 D.C. area restaurants during their time in the White House, a record for the modern era. They also made a habit of visiting local bookstores and haunts like Ben’s Chili Bowl. Vice President Mike Pence, who has already made a foreign trip and is regularly at the Capitol meeting with lawmakers, has stepped in to fill the void. It was Pence who took up a rake to clear damage at a Jewish cemetery in Missouri, and it is Pence who will be dispatched to Louisville, Kentucky, this weekend to pitch the new health care law. Others frequently dine with guests at the Trump International Hotel or show up for dinners at embassies. Trump keeps it real by talking to his old New York friends, using a cellphone that he personally answers, and he stays up late watching TV, before getting up early to watch more TV and read the newspapers. “Because he loves to work, he sleeps only three or four hours a night. It’s most convenient for him to live close to his office which is what he did in New York, what he’s doing at the White House,” said Ronald Kessler, a Trump friend who met him while writing a book on Palm Beach in the late 1980s and regularly attends the Mar-a-Lago New Year’s Eve festivities. “He loves his own territory, he almost never goes to another restaurant aside from his own eating facilities.” At Mar-a-Lago, he usually sticks to the same routine. He wakes up early, reads newspapers and watches TV and tweets before heading to the links. He then makes calls or takes meetings in the afternoon, before dining among the crowd and greeting guests at night. ""You aren't going to see him sitting by the pool,"" one person who knows him well said. Part of that, Kessler says, is because of Trump’s years as a celebrity and a walking brand. Unlike Obama, who used his presidential outings to draw attention to innovative chefs or small-business owners, Trump is focused on making himself the center of attention. “At Palm Beach, you will never see him at a restaurant, and part of it is to promote his own brand,” Kessler said. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. And he has surprised friends by liking the White House so much and not wanting to return to New York most weekends. “I said the president was not going to be happy — White House — with all the security, but Melania told me he loved it, he was calling her every night — he loved the job, he was working more hours than ever before,” Ruddy said. “It's amazing to me that it's the same Donald Trump I've always known. He is doing the same things. Now he's talking a lot more about politics and the government instead of his businesses and TV show.” Last weekend, the vice president spoke at the Gridiron Dinner, and he has frequently gone out to dine in Georgetown, according to people who know him. Trump has stuck to often eating his favorite dish in the White House: meatloaf. “He doesn’t change,” said Kessler. “He is a creature of habit. … And it works for him.” "
8.400136650466918e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:37:19 +0000 2017	"The long-promised GOP bill to repeal and replace Obamacare is facing opposition from all sides, and a constellation of conservative and moderate Republicans have attacked the legislation, even though it has the support of President Donald Trump, Democrats, of course, are unified in their opposition. The bill is being debated in the House of Representatives, where it will move through four committees before a vote proceeds on the House floor. Republican leaders want to vote on the legislation on March 23, the day Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, but they don’t have much room for error. Republicans can afford to lose 21 votes in the House and pass the bill with a simple majority of 216 votes.   Though the bill could undergo significant changes in the coming weeks, the slim Republican majority in the Senate means just a few defections could sink or severely delay its potential passage. Here is a list of all the players opposed in some form to the legislation, passage of which would fulfill the GOP’s biggest campaign pledge, and what they can do to change or stop it. Conservative House Republicans Conservative Republicans in the House, including a group dubbed the Freedom Caucus that’s led by Mark Meadows of North Carolina, worry that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare. Members say portions of the legislation would create a new federal entitlement, akin to Medicare, that would cost billions and add to the national debt. Some conservative members have vowed to vote against the bill in its current form and have offered an alternative plan that fully repeals Obamacare without a replacement. Conservative members could be persuaded to vote for the legislation if they are assured it will not significantly increase federal spending. Moderate House Republicans Moderate Republicans, many who represent districts with constituents dependent on Obamacare , are worried that the current legislation will force people in their districts to lose health insurance. If that happens, they could be vulnerable during the 2018 elections. If conservative Republicans get their way and more provisions of Obamacare are scaled back or repealed, then moderates will be less likely to support it. If moderates get their way, some conservatives will not vote for the bill. Conservative Senate Republicans Kentucky’s Rand Paul is leading an effort in the Senate to derail the proposal and replace it with a bill that fully repeals Obamacare, and he has Utah’s Mike Lee on his side. Texas’ Ted Cruz also wants to see major changes before voting in favor of the bill. All three senators are closely aligned with a slew of conservative activist groups that have blasted the current Republican proposal as a watered-down version of Obamacare. The groups, including Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, are major supporters of the three senators. If the trio capitulates, Paul, Lee and Cruz run the risk of angering their conservative base. The opposition of all three is significant because Republicans hold only a four-vote majority in the Senate. If all three vote against an Obamacare replacement proposal, it will fail. Moderate Senate Republicans Four Senate Republicans, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Rob Portman of Ohio, vowed to vote against rolling back Medicaid expansion , a key portion of the bill for conservative members. Murkowski went one step further, vowing support for Planned Parenthood earlier this week. The women’s health organization, which also performs abortions, faces a significant reduction in funding under the current proposal. A number of other senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Marco Rubio of Florida, have also expressed concerns about the bill in its current form. Again, if three Senate Republicans vote against the legislation, it will fail. Outside medical interest groups Every major hospital entity, along with America’s largest interest group, the AARP, is on the record opposing the bill. They are worried that rolling back Medicaid expansion could result in millions of Americans losing health coverage. “We are very concerned that the draft legislative proposal being considered by the House committees could lead to tremendous instability for those seeking affordable coverage,” the medical groups said in a letter Wednesday to Congress . “Furthermore, we are deeply concerned that the proposed Medicaid program restructuring will result in both the loss of coverage for current enrollees as well as cuts to a program that provides health care services for our most vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly and disabled.” Outside conservative interest groups A number of influential conservative interest groups are vocally opposed to the plan, arguing that Americans deserve a full repeal of Obamacare. Heritage Action and FreedomWorks have begun rolling out ads blasting the Republican-sponsored measure. FreedomWorks has pledged to spend $250,000 to oppose the bill in the coming weeks, and the groups carry clout with conservative Republican voters and donors. So who supports this bill? House Republicans on the two committees that marked up the bill this week have been unified in their support, although no conservative Freedom Caucus members have had the opportunity to officially weigh in yet. The committees are led by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who supports the legislation as part of his “better way” agenda. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an association of thousands of businesses across the country, also supports the bill. Trump and his health and human services secretary, former Rep. Tom Price, support the legislation but are open to changes and suggestions from Congress. Just a reminder: Senate Democrats were forced to broker multiple compromises within their own party in 2010 to pass the original version of Obamacare, and they had a much larger majority at the time than Senate Republicans currently enjoy, leaving Trump and Ryan little room for intraparty dissent.

During the first week of the 114 th  Congress, the House took steps to mitigate some of the more egregious side effects of the ACA's mandates.  On January 6, 2015, the House passed H.R. 22, the Hire More Heroes Act of 2015.  This legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to permit an employer, when determining whether it must provide health care coverage to its employees under the ACA, to exclude employees who have coverage under a health care program administered by the Department of Defense—including TRICARE or coverage provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This legislation, which has since become law, encourages small businesses across the country to hire veteran’s who have served our country honorably.  On January 8, 2015, the House passed H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act.  This legislation would repeal the 30-hour definition of full-time employee in the ACA for purposes of the employer mandate and replace it with a 40-hour definition for a full-time employee.   The 30-hour definition of full-time employment in the ACA has harmed job creation and growth, especially among low income Americans.  I was pleased to support and see the passage of both of these bills in the House, and I look forward to further Senate consideration of H.R. 30.    There is no doubt that health care reform is needed in this country, but the law the President signed aggravates the worst aspects of the U.S. health care system, without fixing what was and remains broken.  The troubled rollout of the ACA goes far beyond a dysfunctional website.  For too many Americans, the ACA simply means increased costs and cancellation notices.  The negative effects of this law on Americans are sweeping.  In fact, in early December 2015, the Congressional Budget Office noted that, “the labor force is projected to be about 2 million full-time-equivalent workers smaller in 2025 under the ACA than it would have been otherwise.”  Instead of offering quick fixes that only temper the consequences, Congress should instead be focused on offering much-needed reforms to our nation's health care industry. As you may know, the House has acted boldly to make use of the reconciliation process this Congress.  After working to resolve budget differences between the House and the Senate, Representative Tom Price introduced a reconciled budget report on October 16, 2015.  This bill, H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015, dismantles the president's demonstrably unworkable health care law.  H.R. 3762 repeals the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax, and the ""Cadillac"" tax on high value insurance plans.  By eliminating the most coercive and onerous pieces of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and by laying the foundation for a patient-centered system, H.R. 3762 would force President Obama to deal with the fact that his health care law has resulted in higher costs and lower quality care for working families.   H.R. 3762 would also strip federal funds from Planned Parenthood for one year while the House conducts an investigation into whether or not this organization has committed federal crimes related to the harvest and sale of aborted babies' body parts for profit.  To make sure women have access to quality health care, this bill increases funding to the Community Health Center Fund by $235 million dollars in each of the next two fiscal years.  On October 23, 2015, in bipartisan fashion and with my support, the House passed H.R. 3762 by a vote of 240 to 189.  On December 3, 2015, the Senate passed this bill with minor changes by a vote of 52 to 47.  On January 6, 2015, the House once again acted in bipartisan fashion and passed the Senate's version of H.R. 3762 by a vote of 241 to 168.  However, on January 8, 2016, the President vetoed this legislation.  Despite the president's veto, the passage of this budget reconciliation bill is a major victory for those who believe in patient-centered health care reform and the sanctity of human life.  After more than five years of trying to put a bill on the president's desk to repeal his health care law, the Congress was able to hold the president accountable for the unmitigated disaster that is his signature policy item.  In the coming year, Congress will advance solutions that strengthen health care security by taking power away from the government and insurance companies; and instead empowering patients with control over their care.  These solutions should realign incentives so that individuals and their doctors—not government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats—are the nucleus of our health care system.  This requires reforms — which I have introduced in the past — to equalize the tax treatment of health care insurance, invite true choice and competition, and ensure critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid can deliver on their promise in the 21 st  century. House Proposals to Reform Medicare Our government has a spending problem—a problem so large that it is driving up our debt, hurting our nation’s ability to create jobs, and threatening our future.  In the past, Washington has not been truthful about the magnitude of these problems facing our country, but we can no longer afford to put off an honest, fact-based conversation on how to solve them. No one person or party is responsible for the looming crisis.  Yet the facts are clear: major spending increases have failed to deliver promised jobs.  The safety net for the poor is coming apart at the seams.  Government health and retirement programs are growing at unsustainable rates.  The new health care law has created a tremendous fiscal burden, and a complex, inefficient tax code is holding back American families and businesses. The House-passed budget, which was passed last year, repeals the President’s disastrous new health care law and protects the health and retirement security of those who need it.  With the creation of Medicare in 1965, the United States made a commitment to help fund the medical care of elderly Americans to ensure that a serious illness would not exhaust their life savings or the assets and incomes of their working children and younger relatives.  With approximately 10,000 “Baby Boomers” turning 65 every day, Medicare’s structural imbalance threatens beneficiaries’ access to quality, affordable care.  Currently, Medicare reimburses health care providers for services, creating a perverse incentive to order more tests and perform more services than may be necessary as a way to maximize a health care providers’ profits under the program.  By basing payment on volume, not quality, costs rise and efficiency is reduced.  Ultimately, this flaw in the structure of the program is driving up health care costs, which are, in turn, threatening to bankrupt the system – and ultimately the nation.  Unless Congress fixes what’s broken in Medicare, without breaking what’s working, the program will end up causing exactly what it was created to avoid – millions of American seniors without adequate health security and a younger working generation saddled with enormous debts to pay for spending levels that cannot be sustained. It is morally unconscionable for elected leaders to cling to an unsustainable status quo with respect to America’s health and retirement security programs.  Current seniors and future generations deserve better than empty promises and a diminished country.  Current retirees deserve the benefits around which they organized their lives.  Future generations deserve health and retirement security they can count on.  By making gradual structural improvements, Congress can preserve America’s social contract with retired workers. Recognizing the problems facing Medicare, the House-Passed Budget: Strengthens health and retirement security by taking power away from government bureaucrats and empowering patients with control over their care. Repeals the new health care law’s unaccountable board of bureaucrats empowered to cut Medicare in ways that would jeopardize seniors’ access to care. Saves Medicare for current and future generations, with no disruptions for those in and near retirement. For younger workers, when they become eligible, Medicare will provide a premium-support payment and a list of guaranteed coverage options – including a traditional fee-for-service option – from which recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs. Premium support, competitive bidding, and more assistance for those with lower incomes or greater health care needs will ensure guaranteed affordability for all seniors. Allowing the federal government to break its promises to current seniors and to future generations is unacceptable.  The reforms outlined in the budget passed by the House protect and preserve Medicare for those in and near retirement, while saving and strengthening this critical program so that future generations can count on it to be there when they retire. House Proposals to Reform Medicaid Medicaid is meant to offer affordable care to those with limited financial resources including: low income children, parents, women who are pregnant and seniors.  Unfortunately, the program’s costs are bursting at the seams.  The Congressional Budget Office projects federal spending on this program to be $335 billion in Fiscal Year 2015; this amount is expected to grow by 75 percent within the next 10 years.  Should this worrying trend continue to be ignored, Medicaid will continue to overwhelm state and federal budgets and fail the vulnerable people who need it most. Specifically, the House-Passed Budget, which passed last year: Secures the Medicaid benefit by converting the federal share of Medicaid spending into a block grant tailored to meet each state’s needs, indexed for inflation and population growth. This reform ends the misguided one-size-fits-all approach that has tied the hands of so many state governments.  States will no longer be shackled by federally determined program requirements and enrollment criteria.  Instead, they will have the freedom and flexibility to tailor a Medicaid program that fits the needs of their unique populations. Improves the health care safety net for low-income Americans by giving states the ability to offer their Medicaid populations more options and better access to care.  Medicaid recipients, like all Americans, deserve to choose their own doctors and make their own health care decisions, instead of having Washington dictate those decisions for them. Repeals the Medicaid expansion contained in the President’s Health Care Law and removes the laws burdensome programmatic mandates on state governments. All Americans will pay more because of this broken Medicaid system – and not just in higher taxes. Because Medicaid’s reimbursement rates have been ratcheted down to below-market levels, the care that Medicaid patients receive is often substandard.  Offering states more flexibility for their Medicaid beneficiaries will remove the stigma Medicaid recipients face, and allow them to take advantage of a range of available options.  Several of the nation’s governors have made innovative proposals to fix Medicaid.  The House passed budget encourages further efforts in this direction.

8.400059500021228e+17	Fri Mar 10 01:06:39 +0000 2017	"WASHINGTON ― There are a number of winners and losers in the Republican health care plan unveiled this week, but one particular population seems to draw the toughest GOP ire: lottery winners. The GOP’s Obamacare replacement targets jackpot winners by having their one-time windfall counted as income over a period of months. That means those lucky people would swiftly be kicked off of Medicaid, and would remain ineligible for government health insurance for a longer time. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which on Wednesday started the process of advancing the legislation through the House, said the lottery provision is part of a broader effort to plug holes in Medicaid. “Each one of these that gets identified, we’re going to go plug, so the money that is there goes to the people who really need it ― low-income Americans on Medicaid who need help with their plans, not somebody who hit the jackpot with the lottery,” Walden told HuffPost. The top Democrat on the committee called the lottery thing a distraction. “How many cases are there like that? I haven’t even seen one. It’s so irrelevant,” Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said. Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the libertarian Cato Institute, called the overall health reform legislation a “train wreck” in an analysis this week , but said in an interview the lottery provision was common sense and easy for lawmakers to explain at town halls and in TV interviews.  “This comes nowhere near salvaging all the awful stuff in the House Republicans’ bill,” Cannon said. President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have championed the bill, which is the long-awaited Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act. The legislation has been panned by an array of outside groups, and it faces deeply uncertain prospects in both the House and the Senate. The bill makes big changes to Medicaid , undoing the Obamacare coverage expansion. Not all members of Congress were familiar with or excited about the lottery piece. “I don’t even know what you’re talking about,” Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) said as he was trying to eat a sandwich. Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) said he didn’t think the lotto provision deserved a lot of attention. “Don’t you think there are other, bigger issues that we need to be dealing with on this?” he asked. “It’s not the biggest part of the bill, but it makes sense,” Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) said. Though it has received little national attention, the lottery provision is one of the only pieces of the overall legislation that got a hearing in advance of Wednesday’s committee votes. Avik Roy, a Republican health policy consultant, outlined the lotto problem for Republicans at last month’s hearing on the provision. “An individual who receives a $10 million lottery in one month is not eligible for Medicaid in that month, because his income is too high,” Roy testified. “But if his income goes to zero for the remainder of the year, he becomes eligible again for Medicaid due to his low monthly income.” Democrats voted against the bill and offered only modest counterarguments, saying there probably aren’t a lot of lottery winners on Medicaid. An expert from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities testified that the proposal was a vast improvement over a previous version Republicans pushed last year. The measure says that jackpots ― as well as other lump-sum payments, such as insurance settlements ― greater than $80,000 would be counted for more than just the one month they landed in a Medicaid recipient’s bank account. Every additional $10,000 above a $100,000 threshold would be considered income for an additional month, for up to 10 years. States would be allowed to make hardship exemptions. Kicking lotto winners off government programs has been something of a Republican pet project for a few years, one that has roots in local news reports of people with winning tickets remaining on public benefits instead of immediately reporting their windfall to the government (which they are already supposed to do). In response to news reports of lotto-winning welfare recipients ― including the story of Amanda Clayton, an unemployed Michigan woman who won $1 million from the lottery, but continued receiving food stamps ― the Michigan legislature in 2011 approved a law ordering the state lottery to share information on winners with the state Department of Human Services. That agency has subsequently put out reports detailing welfare payments to hundreds of lotto winners each year. Republicans in Congress pointed to the Michigan example in justifying their legislation at a hearing last month. The Congressional Budget Office said in 2016 that a more stringent version of the language included in the GOP health care bill would save more than $400 million over a period of 10 years . That’s  a lot of money, but not on the scale of Medicaid, which insures tens of millions of Americans and is projected to cost trillions over that time frame. Republicans in Congress and state legislatures have introduced many bills that target the supposed bad behavior of people on public benefits, whether it’s food stamp recipients eating junk food, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families beneficiaries withdrawing cash benefits from ATMs inside liquor stores.   Congress also targeted lottery winners when it reauthorized the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in 2014, requiring state agencies that administer SNAP to work with state gaming agencies on determining someone’s winnings. Poor people are likelier than the wealthy to play lotteries, which earn states tens of billions of dollars that are typically used to bolster education budgets. Haters have likened lotteries to a tax on the poor.   Clayton, the Michigan lottery winner prosecuted by the state’s attorney general for continuing to receive food stamps, found herself in a harsh media spotlight amid the state’s crackdown on welfare fraud. She wound up dead in 2012 from an accidental overdose of anti-anxiety medication, according to the Wayne County coroner’s office. Her boyfriend told a local TV station that of the $1 million she’d won ― about 40 percent of which would have gone to taxes ― only $67,000 remained. Matt Fuller contributed reporting.

8.400041402689413e+17	Fri Mar 10 00:59:28 +0000 2017	"WASHINGTON ― Leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, unhappy with the Republican health care legislation being rushed through the House by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), are taking their concerns directly to President Donald Trump. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and former Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) spent Thursday afternoon at the White House, meeting with budget staffers, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, and Trump himself. The group met for “hours,” according to Meadows, and Trump attended for “a very lengthy time.” “It was an extremely productive day with the president,” Meadows told a small group of reporters later. Freedom Caucus members are demanding changes to the health care bill that Republican House leaders refuse to make. While Meadows wouldn’t provide details, he said the group discussed amendments to the legislation with Trump, as well as the president’s broader concerns about health reform. “The president actually shared with me that he wants to make sure he lowers premiums for Americans, and he wants to make sure that we get this done quickly,” Meadows said. Conservatives have criticized the GOP health care plan because it seems unlikely to lead to lower premiums. “No one’s saying that the premiums will go do down,” Freedom Caucus member Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “No one’s saying that about the cost of health care. And I don’t think leadership is being honest with the president about this.” Asked later Thursday if conservatives were going around Ryan to negotiate directly with Trump, Labrador said the Freedom Caucus has tried negotiating with House leadership. Now, he suggested, conservatives were trying a different strategy. “We’re appealing to a president who likes to negotiate, who likes to win, and who likes to keep his promises,” Labrador said. “President Trump needs to understand that we as the Freedom Caucus are trying to protect him from the same old lines that leadership gives everybody over the last few years,” Labrador said earlier in the day. “And he needs to remember that it wasn’t Paul Ryan who was standing by him when the chips were down. It was people like myself and others who were standing by him.” Labrador added that he didn’t want to turn negotiations into an “us-versus-them,” and that conservatives were just trying to help Trump keep promises. “This bill is not it,” Labrador said.  Tom Williams via Getty Images The White House has sent mixed messages about where it stands on the GOP health care bill ― lauding it at the same time that Trump and his administration say they’re willing to negotiate.  Ryan has said he’s open to minor changes, but not to the core of the legislation. Conservatives say that position won’t fly, and want more than just tweaks. Meadows and other Freedom Caucus members didn’t want to talk about specific amendments with reporters, but they’re likely to push to restructure some portion of the bill’s advance refundable tax credits, which they don’t like in principle. Meadows noted that the Freedom Caucus is just one constituency the legislation has to please, and that its members would be willing to make concessions. “It’s gotta be good for all concerned,” Meadows said. Some conservatives may be willing to budge on the Medicaid expansion, and the timeline for its expiration. They were cagey about specifics because there isn’t a consensus within their group. That lack of consensus has led Ryan to believe he can push the health care bill through the House if he just gets Trump’s help. The speaker literally rolled up his sleeves on Thursday to give the press a gimmicky PowerPoint presentation that explained the bill. But he also presented the legislation as a “binary choice.” That phrase instantly got under the skin of some conservatives. “I didn’t realize we were computers,” Labrador told HuffPost. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), who had already spoken out against Ryan’s presentation of the GOP legislation as “take it or leave it,” said it’s not a yes or no. “That’s false,” Amash said. “You want me to use my Paris line? You can just rehash that one and put it in your article again,” Amash continued, referring to his comment that Ryan’s ultimatum was “ like saying, ‘If we don’t eat dinner in Paris tonight, our families will starve.’” Amash noted Thursday night that conservatives may have better luck negotiating with Trump, and other Freedom Caucus members backed that up. “The leadership team has been saying take it or leave it, so there’s no headway to be made there,” Amash said. “If you read The Art of the Deal , this is a guy that is going to negotiate,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said. “That’s what a real estate guy does.” The GOP legislation has a number of policy and political problems. It ’s a tightly configured balancing act meant to keep moderates on board. But it already appears it will have vote problems if it reaches the Senate, and further giving in to conservatives would probably exacerbate that situation. Conservatives say that’s a moot issue because the bill simply won’t pass the House if it isn’t tailored to their liking. Ryan’s plan was to force this bill down conservatives’ throats , daring them to vote against an Obamacare repeal that every Republican has campaigned on for years. Even though Freedom Caucus leaders swear they have the votes to take the legislation down, there were early signs that leadership could pick off some conservatives and convince them to support the bill. “There’s a number of people trying to get to yes,” Freedom Caucus board member Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) told HuffPost on Wednesday. “They’re trying to get to a yes. I don’t think it’s fair to the Freedom Caucus for y’all to paint us as obstructionist.” Some Freedom Caucus members,  would probably support the legislation even without significant changes, particularly if Trump works with GOP leaders to pressure vulnerable members. But Trump isn’t moving in that direction. He’s  working with the Freedom Caucus to push the legislation farther to the right. And Ryan is left to wonder what his bill will look like when they’re done. This article has been updated to include a comment from Rep. Paul Gosar.

In this dance, she was depicting an artist trying so hard to perform, that they suffer a kind of writer’s block.  When she gagged and choked to depict paralysis, many interpreted it as vomiting.  Mayor Strimling said it could be a tough act to follow.  “She challenged us, she entertained us, it was risky, it was great,” said Strimling.  Published at 11:12 AM EST on Mar 8, 2017 | Updated at 6:32 PM EST on Mar 8, 2017 "
8.400022254307779e+17	Fri Mar 10 00:51:51 +0000 2017	"The Trump Tower Baku never opened. Trump partnered with an Azerbaijani family that U.S. officials called notoriously unethical. Credit Photograph by Davide Monteleone for The New Yorker Heydar Aliyev Prospekti, a broad avenue in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, connects the airport to the city. The road is meant to highlight Baku’s recent modernization, and it is lined with sleek new buildings. The Heydar Aliyev Center, an undulating wave of concrete and glass, was designed by Zaha Hadid. The state oil company is housed in a twisting glass tower, and the headquarters of the state water company looks like a giant water droplet. “It’s like Potemkin,” my translator told me. “It’s only the buildings right next to the road.” Behind the gleaming structures stand decaying Soviet-era apartment blocks, with clothes hanging out of windows and wallboards exposed by fallen brickwork. As you approach the city center, a tower at the end of the avenue looms in front of you. Thirty-three stories high and curved to resemble a sail, the building was clearly inspired by the Burj Al Arab Hotel, in Dubai, but it is boxier and less elegant. When I visited Baku, in December, five enormous white letters glowed at the top of the tower: T-R-U-M-P. The building, a five-star hotel and residence called the Trump International Hotel & Tower Baku, has never opened, though from the road it looks ready to welcome the public. Reaching the property is surprisingly difficult; the tower stands amid a welter of on-ramps, off-ramps, and overpasses. During the nine days I was in town, I went to the site half a dozen times, and on each occasion I had a comical exchange with a taxi-driver who had no idea which combination of turns would lead to the building’s entrance. The more time I spent in the neighborhood, the more I wondered how the hotel could have been imagined as a viable business. The development was conceived, in 2008, as a high-end apartment building. In 2012, after Donald Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, signed multiple contracts with the Azerbaijani developers behind the project, plans were made to transform the tower into an “ultra-luxury property.” According to a Trump Organization press release, a hotel with “expansive guest rooms” would occupy the first thirteen floors; higher stories would feature residences with “spectacular views of the city and Caspian Sea.” For an expensive hotel, the Trump Tower Baku is in an oddly unglamorous location: the underdeveloped eastern end of downtown, which is dominated by train tracks and is miles from the main business district, on the west side of the city. Across the street from the hotel is a discount shopping center; the area is filled with narrow, dingy shops and hookah bars. Other hotels nearby are low-budget options: at the AYF Palace, most rooms are forty-two dollars a night. There are no upscale restaurants or shops. Any guests of the Trump Tower Baku would likely feel marooned. The timing of the project was also curious. By 2014, when the Trump Organization publicly announced that it was helping to turn the tower into a hotel, a construction boom in Baku had ended, and the occupancy rate for luxury hotels in the city hovered around thirty-five per cent. Jan deRoos, of Cornell University, who is an expert in hotel finance, told me that the developer of a five-star hotel typically must demonstrate that the project will maintain an average occupancy rate of at least sixty per cent for ten years. There is a long-term master plan to develop the area around the Trump Tower Baku, but if it is implemented the hotel will be surrounded for years by noisy construction projects, making it even less appealing to travellers desiring a luxurious experience—especially considering that there are many established hotels on the city’s seaside promenade. There, an executive from ExxonMobil or the Israeli cell-phone industry can stay at the Four Seasons, which occupies a limestone building that evokes a French colonial palace, or at the J. W. Marriott Abershon Baku, which has an outdoor terrace overlooking the water. Tiffany, Ralph Lauren, and Armani are among the dozens of companies that have boutiques along the promenade. A former top official in Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Tourism says that, when he learned of the Trump hotel project, he asked himself, “Why would someone put a luxury hotel there? Nobody who can afford to stay there would want to be in that neighborhood.” The Azerbaijanis behind the project were close relatives of Ziya Mammadov, the Transportation Minister and one of the country’s wealthiest and most powerful oligarchs. According to the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, Azerbaijan is among the most corrupt nations in the world. Its President, Ilham Aliyev, the son of the former President Heydar Aliyev, recently appointed his wife to be Vice-President. Ziya Mammadov became the Transportation Minister in 2002, around the time that the regime began receiving enormous profits from government-owned oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. At the time of the hotel deal, Mammadov, a career government official, had a salary of about twelve thousand dollars, but he was a billionaire. The Trump Tower Baku originally had a construction budget of a hundred and ninety-five million dollars, but it went through multiple revisions, and the cost ended up being much higher. The tower was designed by a local architect, and in its original incarnation it had an ungainly roof that suggested the spikes of a crown. A London-based architecture firm, Mixity, redesigned the building, softening its edges and eliminating the ornamental roof. By the time the Trump team officially joined the project, in May, 2012, many condominium residences had already been completed; at the insistence of Trump Organization staffers, most of the building’s interior was gutted and rebuilt, and several elevators were added. After Donald Trump became a candidate for President, in 2015, Mother Jones , the Associated Press, the Washington Post , and other publications ran articles that raised questions about his involvement in the Baku project. These reports cited a series of cables sent from the U.S. Embassy in Azerbaijan in 2009 and 2010, which were made public by WikiLeaks. In one of the cables, a U.S. diplomat described Ziya Mammadov as “notoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.” The Trump Organization’s chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told reporters that the Baku hotel project raised no ethical issues for Donald Trump, because his company had never engaged directly with Mammadov. According to Garten, Trump played a passive role in the development of the property: he was “merely a licensor” who allowed his famous name to be used by a company headed by Ziya Mammadov’s son, Anar, a young entrepreneur. It’s not clear how much money Trump made from the licensing agreement, although in his limited public filings he has reported receiving $2.8 million. (The Trump Organization shared documents that showed an additional payment of two and a half million dollars, in 2012, but declined to disclose any other payments.) Trump also had signed a contract to manage the hotel once it opened, for an undisclosed fee tied to the hotel’s performance. The Washington Post published Garten’s description of the deal, and reported that Donald Trump had “invested virtually no money in the project while selling the rights to use his name and holding the contract to manage the property.” A month after Trump was elected President, Garten announced that the Trump Organization had severed its ties with the hotel project, describing the decision to CNN as little more than “housecleaning.” I was in Baku at the time, and it had become clear that the Trump Organization’s story of the hotel was incomplete and inaccurate. Trump’s company had made the deal not just with Anar Mammadov but also with Ziya’s brother Elton—an influential member of the Azerbaijani parliament. Elton signed the contracts, and in an interview he confirmed that he founded Baku XXI Century, the company that owns the Trump Tower Baku. When he was asked who owns Baku XXI Century, he called it a “commercial secret” but added that he “controlled all its operations” until 2015, when he cut ties to the company. Elton denied having used his political position for profit. An Azerbaijani lawyer who worked on the project revealed to me that the Trump Organization had not just licensed the family name; it also had signed a technical-services agreement in which it promised to help its partner meet Trump design standards. Technical-services agreements are often nominal addenda to licensing deals. Major hospitality brands compile exhaustive specifications for licensed hotels, and tend to approve design elements remotely; a foreign site is visited only occasionally. But in the case of Trump Tower Baku the oversight appears to have been extensive. The Azerbaijani lawyer told me, “We were always following their instructions. We were in constant contact with the Trump Organization. They approved the smallest details.” He said that Trump staff visited Baku at least monthly to give the go-ahead for the next round of work orders. Trump designers went to Turkey to vet the furniture and fabrics acquired there. The hotel’s main designer, Pierre Baillargeon, and several contractors told me that they had visited the Trump Organization headquarters, in New York, to secure approval for their plans. Ivanka Trump was the most senior Trump Organization official on the Baku project. In October, 2014, she visited the city to tour the site and offer advice. An executive at Mace, the London-based construction firm that oversaw the tower’s conversion to a hotel, met with Ivanka in Baku and New York. He told me, “She had very strong feelings, not just about the design but about the back of the hotel—landscaping, everything.” The Azerbaijani lawyer said, “Ivanka personally approved everything.” A subcontractor noted that Ivanka’s team was particular about wood panelling: it chose an expensive Macassar ebony, from Indonesia, for the ceiling of the lobby. The ballroom doors were to be made of book-matched panels of walnut. On her Web site, Ivanka posted a photograph of herself wearing a hard hat inside the half-completed hotel. A caption reads, “Ivanka has overseen the development of Trump International Hotel & Tower Baku since its inception, and she recently returned from a trip to the fascinating city in Azerbaijan to check in on the project’s progress.” (Ivanka Trump declined requests to discuss the Baku project.) Jan deRoos, the Cornell professor, developed branded-hotel properties before entering academia. He told me that the degree of the Trump Organization’s involvement in the Baku property was atypical. “That’s very, very intense,” he said. The sustained back-and-forth between the Trump Organization and the Mammadovs has legal significance. If parties involved in the Trump Tower Baku project participated in any illegal financial conduct, and if the Trump Organization exerted a degree of control over the project, the company could be vulnerable to criminal prosecution. Tom Fox, a Houston lawyer who specializes in anti-corruption compliance, said, “It’s a problem if you’re making a profit off of someone else’s corrupt conduct.” Moreover, recent case law has established that licensors take on a greater legal burden when they assume roles normally reserved for developers. The Trump Organization’s unusually deep engagement with Baku XXI Century suggests that it had the opportunity and the responsibility to monitor it for corruption. Before signing a deal with a foreign partner, American companies, including major hotel chains, conduct risk assessments and background checks that take a close look at the country, the prospective partner, and the people involved. Countless accounting and law firms perform this service, as do many specialized investigation companies; a baseline report normally costs between ten thousand and twenty-five thousand dollars. A senior executive at one of the largest American hotel chains, who asked for anonymity because he feared reprisal from the Trump Administration, said, “We wouldn’t look at due diligence as a burden. There certainly is a cost to doing it, especially in higher-risk places. But it’s as much an investment in the protection of that brand. It’s money well spent.” Alan Garten told me that the Trump Organization had commissioned a risk assessment for the Baku deal, but declined to name the company that had performed it. The Washington Post article on the Baku project reported that, according to Garten, the Trump Organization had undertaken “extensive due diligence” before making the hotel deal and had not discovered “any red flags.” But the Mammadov family, in addition to its reputation for corruption, has a troubling connection that any proper risk assessment should have unearthed: for years, it has been financially entangled with an Iranian family tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideologically driven military force. In 2008, the year that the tower was announced, Ziya Mammadov, in his role as Transportation Minister, awarded a series of multimillion-dollar contracts to Azarpassillo, an Iranian construction company. Keyumars Darvishi, its chairman, fought in the Iran-Iraq War. After the war, he became the head of Raman, an Iranian construction firm that is controlled by the Revolutionary Guard. The U.S. government has regularly accused the Guard of criminal activity, including drug trafficking, sponsoring terrorism abroad, and money laundering. Reuters recently reported that the Trump Administration was poised to officially condemn the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization. I asked Garten how deeply the Trump Organization had looked into the Mammadov family’s political connections. Had it been concerned that Elton Mammadov, as a sitting member of parliament, might exploit his power to benefit the project? How much money had Ziya Mammadov invested in Elton’s company? Garten noted that he didn’t oversee the due-diligence process. “The people who did are no longer at the company,” he said. “I can’t tell you what was done in this situation.” He would not identify the former employees. When I asked him to provide documentation of due diligence, he said that he couldn’t share it with me, because “it’s confidential and privileged.” A 2014 Instagram post of Ivanka Trump at the Baku tower. Photo Illustration by The New Yorker No evidence has surfaced showing that Donald Trump, or any of his employees involved in the Baku deal, actively participated in bribery, money laundering, or other illegal behavior. But the Trump Organization may have broken the law in its work with the Mammadov family. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, passed in 1977, forbade American companies from participating in a scheme to reward a foreign government official in exchange for material benefit or preferential treatment. The law even made it a crime for an American company to unknowingly benefit from a partner’s corruption if it could have discovered illicit activity but avoided doing so. This closed what was known as the “head in the sand” loophole. As a result, American companies must examine potential foreign partners very carefully before making deals with them. I recently spoke with Alexandra Wrage, who runs Trace International, a consortium of three hundred corporations that do business overseas. Trace helps these firms avoid violating the F.C.P.A., and it has a division that can be hired by individual clients to assess potential foreign partners. To comply with the law, Wrage noted, an American company must remain vigilant even after a contract is signed, monitoring its foreign partner to be sure that nobody involved is engaging in bribery or other improprieties. Wrage pointed out that corrupt government leaders often use their children or their siblings to distance themselves from illicit projects. Such an official creates a company in the relative’s name which appears to be independent but is controlled by the official. To lessen the likelihood of an F.C.P.A. violation when working with a company that is owned by a child or a sibling of a government minister, Wrage told me, “you’d need to show that the child has real expertise, real ability to do the work.” Otherwise, Wrage said, “the assumption is that they are a partner entirely because of their ability to use their parent’s power.” Before Elton Mammadov became a member of parliament, in 2000, he was a maintenance engineer who had no experience in real-estate development. When the Trump Organization joined the Baku project, it barred a Mammadov-owned company from doing construction work, because it was deemed incompetent. Wrage said that a U.S. company looking to make a deal with a foreign partner should be confident that the partner has a reasonable likelihood of making a profit from the venture. If the project seems almost guaranteed to lose money, it could well be a bribery scheme or some other criminal operation. The partner also should uphold modern accounting standards. “It’s simple,” she said. “Will money flow through this business because it offers a compelling product at a decent price, or will the money come because of an illicit relationship with someone who uses their power?” Wrage told me that, in 2009, an American entrepreneur was successfully prosecuted for his part in a corruption conspiracy in Azerbaijan. Frederic Bourke, the co-founder of Dooney & Bourke, the handbag company, had invested in a project in which a foreign partner paid bribes to Azerbaijani government officials and their family members. Bourke was sentenced to a year in prison for violating the F.C.P.A.; he appealed the conviction, claiming ignorance of the corruption. Two years later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the conviction, saying that, regardless of whether he had known about the bribes, “the testimony at trial demonstrated that Bourke was aware of how pervasive corruption was in Azerbaijan.” The F.C.P.A., they said, also criminalized “conscious avoidance”—a deliberate effort to remain in the dark about any transgressions a foreign partner might be involved in. After Bourke’s conviction, Wrage said, U.S. companies were well aware of the dangers of making careless deals in Azerbaijan. Even a cursory look at the Mammadovs suggests that they are not ideal partners for an American business. Four years before the Trump Organization announced the Baku deal, WikiLeaks released the U.S. diplomatic cables indicating that the family was corrupt; one cable mentioned the Mammadovs’ link to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. In 2013, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project investigated the Mammadov family’s corruption and published well-documented exposés. Six months before the hotel announcement, Foreign Policy ran an article titled “The Corleones of the Caspian,” which suggested that the Mammadovs had exploited Ziya’s position as Transportation Minister to make their fortunes. The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty investigation revealed that Baku XXI Century, the company controlled by Elton, had at least two other stakeholders. One of them was a company called zqan , an acronym for the family members of the Transportation Minister: Ziya Mammadov; Qanira, his wife; Anar, his son; and Nigar, his daughter. Anar is the official head of zqan . Another stakeholder in Baku XXI Century was the Baghlan Group, a company run by an Azerbaijani businessman who is known to be close to Ziya Mammadov. Baku XXI Century, zqan, and Baghlan have so many overlapping interests that they often seem to operate as a single concern. According to the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty investigation, the companies all prospered largely through contracts with the Transportation Ministry. The Trump Tower Baku complex was built partly on land controlled by the ministry. A Baghlan subsidiary received a contract from the ministry to import a thousand London-style cabs to Baku. Soon afterward, ministry inspectors began preventing competing taxi services from parking in the city center or at subway stops. Another new rule required all taxi owners to pay taxes and license fees at the Bank of Azerbaijan, a private entity that at the time was owned jointly by Anar Mammadov and Baghlan. Anar’s net worth has been estimated at a billion dollars, but he is not a self-made man. According to the Associated Press, zqan was founded in 2000, when he was in his late teens. He began studying in England that year, and remained there until 2005; during that period, the company that he ostensibly ran experienced explosive growth. Trump Organization officials, as well as others familiar with the Baku project, told me that during the tower’s construction Anar was barely involved, and was often travelling abroad. (He flies on a Gulfstream G450 private jet.) An American who did business in Azerbaijan told me, “It’s common knowledge there that Ziya Mammadov controls zqan .” One of the cables sent in 2010 by the U.S. Embassy in Baku noted that, “with so much of the nation’s oil wealth being poured into road construction,” the Mammadovs had become disproportionately powerful in Azerbaijan. Another cable suggested that Ziya controlled zqan , the country’s “largest commercial development company.” This cable described Ziya as being the object of “many allegations from Azerbaijani contacts of creative corrupt practices.” Much of the land occupied by the Trump Tower Baku complex was once packed with houses. In 2011, residents received letters from the local government authority informing them that their homes were to be demolished to make way for a project of crucial government significance. Thirty families were evicted. One resident, Minaye Azizova, told me that the government gave her eighteen thousand dollars in compensation for a home that, by her estimation, was worth five times as much. After she discovered that her home had been condemned so that Baku XXI Century could build a luxury tower, she sued the government. “Turns out the sound of the squeaky toy was coming from inside the house.” Construction of the building began in 2008. I have spoken with more than a dozen contractors who worked on it. Some of them described behavior that seemed nakedly corrupt. Frank McDonald, an Englishman who has had a long career doing construction jobs in developing countries, performed extensive work on the building’s interior. He told me that his firm was always paid in cash, and that he witnessed other contractors being paid in the same way. At the offices of Anar Mammadov’s company, he said, “they would give us a giant pile of cash,” adding, “I got a hundred and eighty thousand dollars one time, which I fit into my laptop bag, and two hundred thousand dollars another time.” Once, a colleague of his picked up a payment of two million dollars. “He needed to bring a big duffelbag,” McDonald recalled. The Azerbaijani lawyer confirmed that some contractors on the Baku tower were paid in cash. Two people who worked on the Trump Tower Baku told me that bribes were paid. Much of the graft was routine: Azerbaijani tax officials, government inspectors, and customs officers showed up occasionally to pick up envelopes of cash. The executive at Mace, the construction firm, told me that the Mammadovs handled payments and all interactions with the Azerbaijani government. “Were people bribed?” he said. “I don’t know. Maybe. We didn’t check.” (A spokesman for Mace said that the firm was “not involved” in any corruption.) Pierre Baillargeon, the architect whom the Mammadovs hired to alter the tower’s original design, is a Canadian who runs a studio in London. He has often worked in parts of the world known for corruption, including Sudan and Syria, and has done several projects in Azerbaijan. In a phone interview, Baillargeon said that he knew nothing about corruption and was “just a designer.” I asked him why he thought the hotel had been built in such an inhospitable part of Baku. “Every project has detractors,” he said. When I asked him if he had seen large payments being made in cash, he hung up. (He did not respond to later calls.) Alan Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, did not deny that there was corruption involved in the project. “I’m not going to sit here and defend the Mammadovs,” he said. But, from a legal standpoint, he argued, the Trump Organization was blameless. In his opinion, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act doesn’t apply to the Baku deal, even if corruption occurred. “We didn’t own it,” he said of the hotel. “We had no equity. We didn’t control the project. The flow of funds is in the wrong direction.” He added, “We did not pay any money to anyone. Therefore, it could not be a violation of the F.C.P.A.” “No, that’s just wrong,” Jessica Tillipman, an assistant dean at George Washington University Law School, who specializes in the F.C.P.A., said. “You can’t go into business deals in Azerbaijan assuming that you are immune from the F.C.P.A.” She added, “Nor can you escape liability by looking the other way. The entire Baku deal is a giant red flag—the direct involvement of foreign government officials and their relatives in Azerbaijan with ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Corruption warning signs are rarely more obvious.” Tillipman explained that the F.C.P.A. defines corruption as “the payment of money or anything of value” to a foreign official. Last year, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay two hundred and sixty-four million dollars to settle charges that it had violated the F.C.P.A.; the bank had given jobs and internships to relatives and friends of government officials in Asia. Tillipman, along with several other F.C.P.A. experts, told me that the Trump Organization had clearly provided things of value in the Baku deal: its famous brand, its command of the luxury market, its extensive technical advice. In May, 2012, the month the Baku deal was finalized, the F.C.P.A. was evidently on Donald Trump’s mind. In a phone-in appearance on CNBC, he expressed frustration with the law. “Every other country goes into these places and they do what they have to do,” he said. “It’s a horrible law and it should be changed.” If American companies refused to give bribes, he said, “you’ll do business nowhere.” He continued, “There is one answer—go to your room, close the door, go to sleep, and don’t do any deals, because that’s the only way. The only way you’re going to do it is the other way.” It is unclear how the Trump Administration plans to approach F.C.P.A. enforcement. Jay Clayton, Trump’s choice to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, co-authored a paper in 2011 arguing that American companies were at a severe disadvantage because of the U.S. government’s “singular strategy of zealous enforcement.” But Jeff Sessions, the new Attorney General, told the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings that he will continue to uphold the F.C.P.A. After 9/11, prosecuting financial corruption acquired new political importance. The C.I.A. and other intelligence services came to believe that preventing illicit money from flowing through the global financial system was a necessary tactic in preventing future terrorist attacks, and the U.S. led an international effort to enforce financial transparency. Banks and other financial entities were required to vet their clients aggressively and to report any suspicious activity. Prosecutions for money laundering, bribery, and other financial crimes rose significantly. In 2000, the government launched three prosecutions under the F.C.P.A. Last year, it initiated fifty-four. Investigators of financial fraud like to say that government corruption, money laundering, and other illicit behavior often form a “nexus” with even more troubling activity, such as financing terrorism and developing weapons of mass destruction. This appears to be true in the Baku deal. As the Mammadovs were preparing to build the tower, the family patriarch, Ziya, was cementing his financial relationship with the Darvishis, the Iranian family with ties to the country’s Revolutionary Guard. At least three Darvishis—the brothers Habil, Kamal, and Keyumars—appear to be associates of the Guard. In Farsi press accounts, Habil, who runs the Tehran Metro Company, is referred to as a sardar , a term for a senior officer in the Revolutionary Guard. A cable sent on March 6, 2009, from the U.S. Embassy in Baku described Kamal as having formerly run “an alleged Revolutionary Guard-controlled business in Iran.” The company, called Nasr, developed and acquired instruments, guidance systems, and specialty metals needed to build ballistic missiles. In 2007, Nasr was sanctioned by the U.S. for its role in Iran’s effort to develop nuclear missiles. The cable said that Kamal and Keyumars were frequent visitors to Azerbaijan; Kamal had recently established “a close business relationship/friendship” with Ziya Mammadov, and, with Mammadov’s assistance, had been awarded “at least eight major road construction and rehabilitation contracts, including contracts for construction of the Baku-Iranian Astara highway.” (Keyumars also seems to have been involved in these deals.) The cable added, “We assume Mammedov [sic] is a silent partner in these contracts.” “Does the No. 1 stop here and does that go to Penn Station and can I get a train there to Philadelphia and then how do I get to Walnut Street?” January 10, 2011 Iran has two militaries. The Iranian Army is a conventional force whose mission is to protect the country. The Revolutionary Guard is an independent force of about a hundred and fifty thousand soldiers, whose duty is to protect the country’s Islamic system and to preserve the power of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Revolutionary Guard has its own air force and navy, and it has a unit known as the Quds Force, which the United States has identified as a major supporter of Hezbollah and other international terrorist groups. The Guard has developed a shadow economy within Iran to fund its activities and expand its power. It controls all official border crossings and runs several unofficial ports, solely for its own use. The Revolutionary Guard smuggles into the country everything from consumer goods blocked by sanctions to drugs. It also owns seemingly legitimate companies in construction, energy, telecommunications, auto manufacturing, and banking. According to the United States Institute of Peace, the Guard is linked “to dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of companies that appear to be private in nature but are run by [Revolutionary Guard] veterans.” J. Matthew McInnis, an Iran expert at the American Enterprise Institute, who served as a consultant to Michael Flynn when Flynn was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told me that owners of Revolutionary Guard-related businesses often become rich. But there is a catch: from time to time, they should expect to be asked to serve the needs of the Guard. “When the Revolutionary Guard says, ‘We need to move some illicit stuff,’ or ‘We need new parts for our missiles,’ they reach out to these guys,” McInnis explained. “It’s a soft network that can do all sorts of things that are very hard to trace.” Keyumars Darvishi once ran Raman, a construction firm that is owned by the Islamic Revolution Mostazafan Foundation. According to the United Nations, the foundation is a major financial arm of the Revolutionary Guard. Keyumars left Raman to run Azarpassillo, the putatively independent construction company that received multiple road contracts in Azerbaijan. According to Azarpassillo’s Web site, it was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, Keyumars has also served as the acting director of the Tehran Metro Company, filling in for his brother Habil. Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a political scientist at Syracuse University, who studies the political, economic, and military élite of Iran, said, “It looks like Azarpassillo is a front organization for the Revolutionary Guard.” He found it inconceivable that Keyumars Darvishi, after working for years in a company controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, would quit, raise large amounts of capital on his own, and then become the head of a fully independent company that competed against Revolutionary Guard fronts for contracts. Khatam Al-Anbia, an Iranian construction giant that is controlled by the Guard and is under U.S. sanctions, has subcontracted Azarpassillo on at least two major infrastructure projects in Iran. The Tehran Metro Company is also involved in both projects. McInnis told me, “If you see a connection with Khatam Al-Anbia, you would assume the connections to the Revolutionary Guard are there. The suspicion of Azarpassillo being a front company is certainly worth investigating. It would fit a normal pattern.” Alan Garten told me that the Trump Organization checks to see if potential Trump partners are on “watch lists and sanctions lists,” and that the company knew nothing of Ziya Mammadov’s relationship to the Darvishis until 2015, when it learned that “certain principals associated with the developer may have had some association with some problematic entities.” And yet, by that point, the U.S. Embassy cables had been online for four years. Garten insisted that the Trump Organization still has no idea if the association between the Mammadovs and the Darvishis is real, or if it’s simply an allegation “spread by the media.” I recently spoke with Allison Melia, who until 2015 was one of the C.I.A.’s lead analysts of Iran’s economy; she now works for the Crumpton Group, a strategic advisory firm whose services include conducting due diligence for companies. She told me that her team could have compiled a dossier on the Mammadovs and their connection to the Revolutionary Guard in “a couple of days.” She said that any reputable investigative firm conducting a risk assessment would have advised a U.S. company to avoid a deal with a family connected to the Revolutionary Guard. The U.S. has imposed various sanctions on Iran since the Islamic Revolution, in 1979. In recent years, U.S. and international efforts have focussed on isolating Iran from the global financial system, in order to prevent it from funding terrorist groups and contributing to worldwide instability. In 2015, the U.N., spurred by the Obama Administration, reached an agreement with Iran, and lifted some sanctions in return for a slowdown of the country’s nuclear program. However, according to the Congressional Research Service, many sanctions against Iran remain in effect, because of the country’s “support for terrorism, its human-rights abuses, its interference in specified countries in the region, and its missile and advanced-conventional-weapons programs.” In December, 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives imposed additional sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard and its associated businesses. American companies must insure that they are not receiving funds that originated with any sanctioned entity. Ignorance is not a defense, especially if there is ample warning that a foreign partner could have a link to such an entity. Most firms, upon hearing of even a slight chance of Iranian involvement, conduct due diligence that is much more extensive than what is typical for F.C.P.A. compliance. Erich Ferrari, an attorney who specializes in sanctions-related legal cases, said that before the Trump Organization cashed any checks it should have been certain of “the source of the funds”—“not only the bank it was remitted from but how the Mammadovs actually earned the money they paid.” He said of the Baku deal, “It takes a lot to shock a lawyer, but I’ve had very few clients do so little due diligence.” The nexus between the Mammadovs and the Darvishis suggests both opportunism and desperation. Ziya Mammadov is sixty-four, and in recent years the family’s position in Azerbaijan has begun to weaken. President Aliyev has systematically isolated, and then fired, longtime members of the regime in order to make way for his own cronies. From 2008 to 2014, Ziya Mammadov, perhaps fearing his ejection from political office, vastly increased his personal wealth. During the same period, mounting international sanctions made it far more difficult for Iran to sell oil abroad, receive foreign funds, and import products. International banks became increasingly reluctant to accept funds from businesses owned by the Revolutionary Guard, severely limiting its ability to support allies such as Hezbollah and the Syrian government. At a moment when Iran was struggling to find ways to send money outside the country, Keyumars Darvishi joined Azarpassillo and began making one deal after another in Azerbaijan. Ziya Mammadov apparently had complete discretion with regard to Azarpassillo’s projects. On April 6, 2007, Anne Derse, then the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, wrote in a cable that Charles Redman, at the time a senior vice-president for the American construction firm Bechtel, had recently met with Ziya Mammadov. Redman was looking for business, and knew that Azerbaijan was planning several major new roads. Bechtel could build them, he said, at an average cost of six million dollars per kilometre. Mammadov complained to him that this was too expensive. Bechtel ended up building nothing. Instead, much of the roadwork was done by Azarpassillo—at a much higher cost. According to a 2012 report by Azerbaijan’s Center for Economic and Social Development, an independent think tank, road construction during Mammadov’s tenure was “the most expensive in the world,” costing an average of eighteen million dollars per kilometre. (Derse declined to comment; Redman did not respond to e-mails.) July 20, 2015 The available evidence strongly suggests that Ziya Mammadov conspired with an agent of the Revolutionary Guard to make overpriced deals that would enrich them both while allowing them to flout prohibitions against money laundering and to circumvent sanctions against Iran. Based on Ziya Mammadov’s past, it seems reasonable to assume that his main motive was profit. Like most Azerbaijanis, he is a secular Shiite Muslim, and he has no known ties to hard-line factions in Iran. Why did the Darvishis want to work with the Mammadovs? It might have caught their attention that the Mammadovs had their own private bank—one that had unfettered access to the global financial system. While Azarpassillo was making deals with the Transportation Ministry, the Mammadovs were investing heavily in a series of large construction projects. Money launderers love construction projects. They attract legitimate funds from governments and private investors, and they require frequent payouts to legitimate subcontractors: cement factories, lumberyards, glass manufacturers, craftsmen. In the Trump Tower Baku project, money was going in and out of the U.S., the United Kingdom, Turkey, Romania, the United Arab Emirates, and several other countries. With such projects, it can be exceedingly difficult to detect the spread of illicit funds. At the same time, the Mammadovs’ money was flowing through holding companies in offshore banking centers. According to leaked documents in the Panama Papers, companies controlled by the family have opened accounts in such places as the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, and Panama. The shell companies that list Mammadovs as beneficiaries or officers have bland names such as Trans-European Leasing Group and 1st Rate Investment, and many of them are owned by other shell companies. In 2009, a year after Baku XXI Century began building the tower, the company opened the Baku International Bus Terminal, an enormous station that includes a shopping mall and a hotel. During this period, the Mammadov family also began building a hotel, a golf course, and a spa in the mountains north of Baku. Meanwhile, the Mammadovs spent lavishly on themselves. Ziya built a mansion in one of the most expensive neighborhoods of Baku, and, on the beach, a villa whose walls are decorated to resemble ancient Egyptian bas-reliefs. Elton’s son, Aynar, became famous for having a collection of expensive cars, including a Ferrari, a Maserati, and a Lamborghini. Anar began using the Gulfstream G450, which typically costs forty-one million dollars, and bought a seven-bedroom home in London. He also spent millions of dollars on an effort to promote Azerbaijan in Washington, D.C., hosting galas for members of Congress and other powerful figures. A former associate of the Trump Organization told me that in 2012, on one of Anar’s trips to America, he visited Trump Tower, in New York, to meet with Donald Trump and company executives. (The Trump Organization would not confirm the visit.) Around this time, the contracts for the Baku project were issued. Between 2004 and 2014, Mammadov family businesses spent more than half a billion dollars on large construction projects. They also poured money into a major construction-materials company, an insurance firm, and a new headquarters. It’s not clear how the Mammadovs funded such enormous investments while spending so much on themselves. They may have received loans, or secretly owned profitable businesses that supported the flurry of spending. Another explanation is that some of the investment money came from the Revolutionary Guard, through Azarpassillo. Calls and e-mails to Azarpassillo, the Iranian Mission to the U.N., and the Azerbaijani government were not returned. Ziya and Anar Mammadov did not respond to requests for comment. Donald Trump has not addressed the Baku deal since becoming President. A Department of Justice spokesperson would not comment on the possibility of its investigating the Trump Tower Baku deal. The White House declined to comment. If, as Alan Garten told me, the Trump Organization learned in 2015 about “the possibility” that the Mammadovs had ties to the Revolutionary Guard, it is striking that the company did not end the Baku deal until December, 2016. During this period, Garten told me, the Trump Organization never asked its Azerbaijani partners about the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, but it did send several default notices for late payments. Throughout the Presidential campaign, Trump was in business with someone that his company knew was likely a partner with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. In a March, 2016, speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Trump said that his “No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.” Calling Iran the “biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world,” he promised, “We will work to dismantle that reach—believe me, believe me.” In the speech, Trump lamented that Iran had been allowed to develop new long-range ballistic missiles. According to Iran Watch, an organization that monitors Iran’s military capabilities, much of the technology to make the missiles was provided by Nasr, the company once run by Kamal Darvishi. I asked Garten why the Trump Organization hadn’t cancelled the Baku contract in 2015. He said that there was “no rush,” because “the project had already stalled and was showing no signs of moving forward.” The Azerbaijani lawyer who worked on the project has seen the hotel’s interior, and told me that it is almost finished. In an interview with the magazine Baku , published in April, 2015, Ivanka Trump said that she was eager to enjoy the hotel’s “huge spa area,” and promised that the hotel would open “in June.” Moreover, Garten said, the Trump Organization had signed binding contracts with the Mammadovs and couldn’t simply abandon its agreements. But Jessica Tillipman, the law-school assistant dean, told me, “You can’t violate sanctions just because you have a contract with someone.” According to Erich Ferrari, the lawyer who specializes in sanctions, companies that learn of a possible sanctions violation typically commission a “look-back” investigation that “reviews all payments you received, to make sure they didn’t originate with a sanctioned entity.” He added, “All the big four accounting companies do them routinely.” The Trump Organization did not commission a look-back. The Baku deal appears to be the second time that the Trump Organization has turned a blind eye to U.S. efforts to sanction Iran. In 1998, when Donald Trump purchased the General Motors Building, in Manhattan, he inherited as a tenant Iran’s Bank Melli. The following year, the Treasury Department listed Bank Melli as an institution that was “owned or controlled” by the government of Iran and that was covered by U.S. sanctions. (The department later labelled Bank Melli one of the primary financial institutions through which Iran was funnelling money to finance terrorism and to develop weapons of mass destruction.) The Trump Organization kept Bank Melli as a tenant for four more years before terminating the lease. “He says he loves me, but he still uses his first wife’s birthday as his password.” January 30, 2012 The Baku project is hardly the only instance in which the Trump Organization has been associated with a controversial deal. The Trump Taj Mahal casino, which opened in Atlantic City in 1990, was repeatedly fined for violating anti-money-laundering laws, up until its collapse, late last year. According to ProPublica, Trump projects in India, Uruguay, Georgia, Indonesia, and the Philippines have involved government officials or people with close ties to powerful political figures. A few years ago, the Trump Organization abandoned a project in Beijing after its Chinese partner became embroiled in a corruption scandal. In December, the Trump Organization withdrew from a hotel project in Rio de Janeiro after it was revealed to be part of a major bribery investigation. Ricardo Ayres, a Brazilian state legislator, told Bloomberg, “It’s curious that the Trumps didn’t seem to know that their biggest deal in Brazil was bankrolled by shady investors.” But, given the Trump Organization’s track record, it seems reasonable to ask whether one of the things it was selling to foreign partners was a willingness to ignore signs of corruption. To this day, the Trump Organization has not provided satisfying answers to the most basic questions about the Baku deal: who owns Baku XXI Century, the company with which they signed the contracts; the origin of the funds with which Baku XXI Century paid the Trump Organization; whether the Mammadovs used their political power to benefit themselves and the Trump Organization; and whether the Mammadovs used money obtained from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to fund the Trump Tower Baku. At one point, Garten allowed me to review the Trump Organization’s original contract with the Mammadovs. It authorizes the company to order an independent audit of Baku XXI Century’s financial records at any time—a provision likely included to insure that the Mammadovs didn’t hide profits that were supposed to be shared with the Trump Organization. Such an audit could well have exposed illicit activity. Garten refused to say if an audit had been conducted. In dealing with the Mammadovs, the Trump Organization seems to have taken them entirely at their word. Garten pointed me to a provision in one contract in which Anar Mammadov represented himself as the sole owner of Baku XXI Century. Given that Elton Mammadov told me that he controlled the company, and that its ownership was a “commercial secret,” what proof did the Trump Organization have that Anar’s claim was true? Garten could not say. Garten has been the company’s chief legal officer only since January. His predecessor was Jason Greenblatt, whose name appeared on the contract I reviewed. Greenblatt was in charge of the Trump Organization’s due diligence and contracting work. He is now employed at the White House, as the President’s special representative for international negotiations. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In recent months, American officials have expressed concern that Trump Administration figures might be blackmailed by foreign entities. U.S. law-enforcement investigators and congressional staffers have probed claims that Russian government officials possess compromising information about President Trump, which might be used to blackmail him. (The President maintains that there is no such information.) In January, the Department of Justice informed the White House that Michael Flynn—then the national-security adviser—was vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians because he had lied about having spoken with the Russian Ambassador. Flynn subsequently resigned. In Azerbaijan, the power and the influence of the Mammadovs has declined sharply. Elton lost his seat in parliament in 2015. In February, Ziya was abruptly removed from his ministry. Anar has settled in London, an associate of his told me, and is living on a fraction of his former wealth. Meanwhile, in Iran, government officials are likely facing additional sanctions on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. If the Mammadovs or powerful Iranians have evidence that the Trump Organization broke laws, they might be tempted to exploit it. The best way to determine if a crime was committed in the Baku deal would be a federal investigation, which could use the power of subpoena and international legal tools to obtain access to the contracts, the due diligence, internal e-mails, and financial documents. The Department of Justice routinely sends investigators to other countries to pursue possible F.C.P.A. and sanctions violations. Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, who is the ranking Democratic member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, said, in an e-mail, that a federal investigation was warranted: “The Trump Organization’s Baku project shows the lack of ‘extreme vetting’ Mr. Trump applied to his own business dealings in corruption-plagued regimes around the globe. . . . Congress—and the Trump Administration itself—has a duty to examine whether the President or his family is exposed to terrorist financing, sanctions, money laundering, and other imprudent associations through their business holdings and connections.” More than a dozen lawyers with experience in F.C.P.A. prosecution expressed surprise at the Trump Organization’s seemingly lax approach to vetting its foreign partners. But, when I asked a former Trump Organization executive if the Baku deal had seemed unusual, he laughed. “No deal there seems unusual, as long as a check is attached,” he said.  ♦ "

One of the men in the piece was Kyle Coddington. He's a contributor for the Outset Network, which reported that he recently completed his first round of chemotherapy and radiation treatments . According to a GoFundMe page that was set up in December, Coddington has been diagnosed with a stage 4 glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. ""Please delete this episode. I look like a balding potato,"" he said in a tweet to Bee. In a followup post he said ""Also, it's not a Nazi haircut. Richard Spencer's is, but mine's from cancer."" The show issued an apology on its official Twitter account. ""We deeply apologize for offending @_that_kyle in our CPAC segment. We only learned of his condition today & have removed him from the piece."" Bee also apologized to Coddington and his sister, whose tweet about the story was liked and shared thousands of times. Coddington's sister tweeted, saying ""When @iamsambee makes fun of your brother for having ""Nazi hair."" He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat."" In a statement published late Thursday night, Kyle Coddington said ""I want to make it clear that half-apologizing for offending someone is not apologizing for making baseless accusations against people because of the way they look. This kind of behavior should be rejected by both sides of the aisle."" Coddington also said he is a registered Democrat and openly ""Never Trump,"" referencing an anti-Trump movement. Coddington said he was overwhelmed by the support he'd received following the segment and thanked Full Frontal for donating to his GoFundMe page. ""Full Frontal with Samantha Bee"" airs on TBS, which is owned by Time Warner, CNN's parent company. "

8.399938980680008e+17	Fri Mar 10 00:18:46 +0000 2017	"Benjamin Sommers is an associate professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a primary care physician at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. From 2011 to 2016, he served as an adviser in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Republican leaders in Congress have at last unveiled their proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. In a nod to a growing number of Republicans concerned that a full repeal would undo coverage gains in their home states, the new plan at first glance appears to protect coverage for those insured under the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. This is a shift from prior Republican health-care legislation — including a plan from new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and the 2015 ACA repeal bill passed by Congress (and vetoed by President Obama), both of which explicitly eliminated the Medicaid expansion. But the fine print of the new proposal instead takes a more insidious approach to gutting the Medicaid expansion. The bill states that anyone experiencing more than a one-month gap in coverage after 2019 would no longer be eligible for the generous 90 percent federal funding the ACA provided to help states expand Medicaid to the working poor. While this may seem like a reasonable way to protect coverage for those who already have it, in practice this means that the Medicaid expansion would wither on the vine and could shrink to nearly nothing in just a few short years. Why? Research over the past decade has documented that coverage in Medicaid is unstable over time. People frequently move in and out of coverage, a phenomenon often called “ churning .” In part, this relates to the program’s administrative features that require frequent eligibility reverification and renewal applications for beneficiaries to maintain coverage — more on that shortly. But it also relates to the fundamental nature of a health-care safety-net program. Eligibility for Medicaid fluctuates with job losses or new employment, seasonal work or overtime, changes in family circumstances such as marriage or divorce and other factors. One study of Medicaid data found that the average enrollee receives Medicaid coverage for only 78 percent of the year, and this figure drops to 68 percent when focusing just on non-elderly, non-disabled adults, the main beneficiaries of the ACA expansion. Another study of national survey data found that 43 percent of adults in Medicaid had experienced a gap in coverage within the first 12 months of enrolling, and 55 percent had a gap within 23 months. In other words, under the GOP bill, the majority of the Medicaid expansion population under the ACA would likely become ineligible for the current level of federal funding in less than two years. But that’s not all. In addition to changes in eligibility, another frequent cause of churning is the Medicaid renewal process. Coverage in Medicaid is time-limited, and beneficiaries must periodically demonstrate their eligibility to stay in the program. The ACA made significant strides in reducing the hassle of applying for and retaining Medicaid coverage, which has produced large enrollment gains even among those already eligible for the program before 2014. But the new GOP bill takes steps in the opposite direction. The bill creates a new requirement that states conduct eligibility re-determinations every six months, rather than annually as under the ACA. It also reduces the ability of states to use “ presumptive eligibility ,” which allows hospitals and other entities to temporarily enroll applicants in Medicaid before their eligibility can be verified. Finally, the bill limits retroactive Medicaid coverage to no more than a month, compared with the current practice of 90 days. This grace period is often critical for people who enroll in Medicaid during health emergencies. Every eligibility re-determination or other enrollment obstacle in Medicaid is an added opportunity for people to fall through the cracks. As a primary care physician, I have seen this countless times. Patients show up for their appointments, only to learn that their Medicaid coverage has lapsed. Our office promptly helps them sign up again, which usually minimizes the disruption to their medical care. But under the GOP bill, people who have moved, lost their mail, filled out a form incorrectly or forgot they needed to renew by a certain date would not lose coverage temporarily — it would likely be lost forever. Putting the pieces together, the GOP bill says that people who have Medicaid expansion coverage can keep it — and by extension, expansion states, hospitals and providers can keep their funding. But in practice, the bill would use churning in Medicaid as a vehicle for dramatically cutting federal support for expansion within just a few years. Worse than that, the bill would make enrollment and renewal of Medicaid coverage even harder, thereby accelerating the expansion’s demise. As consumer groups, providers and expansion-state policymakers consider the GOP’s new “repeal and replace” bill, they should not be deceived by appearances. The ACA’s Medicaid expansion remains squarely in the crosshairs, even if this time the hunters are camouflaged. "
8.399936999918633e+17	Fri Mar 10 00:17:59 +0000 2017	"posted at 8:01 pm on March 8, 2017 by Ed Morrissey Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES There’s no such thing as bad publicity , right? Right, especially when others generate it for you. Either despite or because of a boycott campaign against Ivanka Trump’s designer line, they claim to have scored record sales in February, even after several stores stopped carrying it. The Hill notes the claim , which went viral earlier today: Ivanka Trump’s eponymous women’s fashion line is reporting record sales figures despite calls for a boycott and controversies surrounding President Trump. “Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,” Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, tells Refinery29 in an interview published Tuesday. “For several different retailers Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the [brand’s] best performance ever.” The Refinery29 article takes a more cautious approach to this claim, though. Reporter Ana Colon notes that the line got a huge boost in online searches after the boycott, going from being ranked by Lyst eleventh among all brands by order count, and highest among all those in the Ivanka Trump Collection class of high-couture brands. That was an improvement from being ranked 550th the month before, so clearly the higher profile had a big impact in the immediate time frame around the boycott. Lyst warns that it probably won’t last, though, and points to a similar spike in searches for pantsuits before the election, because of  you know who : However, the spokesperson for Lyst noted that despite having had a big February, “it’s fair to say the surge is not long lasting.” The platform historically observes engagement tied to current events: For instance, before the presidential election, Lyst noted a 460% increase in searches for pantsuits, which it speculated was related to Hillary Clinton. Because Ivanka Trump and her now-unaffiliated brand were widely reported on last month, that could have very well led people to seek out its products online. Plus, after news and tweets broke that some department stores would no longer sell the line (and as a response to the popular #GrabYourWallet protest ), groups of Trump supporters pledged to continue to shop the First Daughter’s brand elsewhere, Business Insider reported. Now that the dust has seemingly settled — at least for now — will Ivanka Trump Collection follow up the flurry of media coverage with another successful month? That much is to be seen. That might not be seen at all. Colon and The Hill both point out that the private collection does not routinely release sales results, so unless the news is especially good, the entire issue will probably drop off the radar screen. Ivanka’s line isn’t exactly intended for mass sales, anyway; it’s aimed at a boutique segment of the market, even if it has been carried by larger chains at times. The dynamic between boycotts, publicity, and interest demonstrates why most boycotts are doomed to failure, even while being a perfectly legitimate free-market response. Most of the time people are unaware of them at all, but when boycotts  do succeed in broad awareness, the first response is curiosity rather than rejection. A few succeed because of overwhelming scorn for the target of the boycott, but almost always the publicity bark is much worse than the bite. In the late 1980s, for instance, director Martin Scorcese released the controversial film  The Last Temptation of Christ to a hailstorm of protests. Various Christian denominations demanded a boycott of the film, demands which generated more curiosity about the art-house film than it did outright rejection. Newspapers debated the boycotts for weeks , adding to the film’s publicity. It got good reviews at the time , perhaps influenced by the pre-release opposition to it, and did middling-to-good box office for a small-budget film. The New York Times reported a sold-out opening at the time: After a month of protests and angry rallies by groups that consider the movie blasphemous, Martin Scorsese’s ”Last Temptation of Christ” opened today to long lines, sold-out theaters and scattered picketing. People eager to buy tickets greatly outnumbered the protesters in all of the nine cities where the movie opened this afternoon. The largest number of demonstrators turned out in New York, where by early evening more than 500 people, many of them Greek Orthodox, were packed into a cordoned-off area in front of the Ziegfeld theater, with 100 police officers looking on. But the number of pickets remained small in other cities. … In many cities the people waiting in line were defiant about their right to see the film. When one picket at the Century City Cineplex in Los Angeles admonished ticket buyers, many of the 150 people who were in line at 10:45 A.M. yelled back that they had the right to see the movie if they wanted to. In response to placards with the word ”Blasphemy,” a man in the ticket line waved a sign that said: ”It’s only a movie.” The boycott turned out to be a bigger bust than the movie. I’ve even heard that Scorcese has managed to carve out a decent career since then despite the boycott, but don’t quote me on that. Almost every public boycott has wound up producing similar results, especially purely political boycotts such as the one aimed at Ivanka’s clothing line. Those ignore the fact that politics leaves tens of millions of potential consumers on the other side of an issue, and that those people will rally to the side of a perceived political ally rather than join a boycott against them, even if they may not have been inclined to patronize that retailer beforehand. But  both of those effects are short-term at best, which means that Ivanka Trump Collection will probably return very shortly to the previous trajectory of their sales figures … at least until her father’s political opponents see fit to provide it with another infusion of free publicity.

8.399856747364844e+17	Thu Mar 09 23:46:05 +0000 2017	"posted at 10:01 am on March 9, 2017 by Ed Morrissey Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES You don’t say. Even as IRS commissioner John Koskinen insisted that his agency had cooperated completely in the scandal over the targeting of conservative groups, even as its defenders claimed that all the evidence had been seen, the IRS keeps finding more and more documents related to the scandal .  Go figure . At least they’re consistent on cooperation, though: The IRS has told a federal court that they’ve recently identified almost 7,000 more documents that could contain information on how the agency targeted the tax-exempt applications of Tea Party organizations or other conservative political groups starting back in 2010, according to a court document. But IRS in the document would not commit to a timeline for releasing the documents. The revelation of thousands of unreleased documents was made in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that specializes in filing, and in many instances litigating, FOIA requests. Er … timeline? Given that several years have gone by, and that both courts and Congress have demanded this information repeatedly, why is the IRS even discussing  timelines ? If they have identified these documents, they should produce them immediately. This could inspire a new move by House Republicans to impeach Koskinen, who managed to avoid that process once. A better question might be why he’s still there at all. Donald Trump took office almost two months ago, and while Koskinen has a set term of office, it’s still a political appointment that serves at the pleasure of a president. Jay Sekulow argues that Trump should boot Koskinen out immediately: President Trump continues to work, as he puts it, to “drain the swamp.” And there’s no better place to focus those efforts than beginning the process of restoring the credibility of the IRS by demanding the resignation of Koskinen. I have repeatedly maintained that we still have an IRS that is corrupt and incapable of self-correction. It was clear President Obama had no intention of removing him. But with President Trump now in the White House, Koskinen must go. The American people deserve nothing less. Why he’s still there at all is a mystery. Koskinen should have been asked to leave at 12:01 pm on January 20th. Firing Koskinen wouldn’t just be a good decision for political purposes to build up some goodwill with House conservatives who have been demanding his head for years, it would be a major demonstration of swamp-draining, as Sekulow rightly argues. Koskinen should have been on Trump’s Day 1 agenda. This new disclosure gives the White House a new opportunity. If they want to highlight abuses of power in the previous administration, they don’t need to claim wiretapping of Trump Tower to do it. They should instead highlight this case of the use of the IRS to punish political opponents of the Obama White House and pledge a new effort to expose everyone involved in it. That makes it less about Trump personally and more about the activists and voters who supported him. It’s a gift from the IRS, which comes along very rarely. Will the White House recognize it?

8.399777330776637e+17	Thu Mar 09 23:14:32 +0000 2017	"A Republican proposal to ­revise the Affordable Care Act claimed its first major victories Thursday amid a backlash that both Republican leaders and President Trump spent the day trying to tamp down. Trump met with conservative critics of the plan, signaling both a willingness to negotiate its details and that it does not yet have enough votes to emerge from the House. More acknowledgment of the proposal’s problems came from Senate Republicans, who suggested Thursday that the measure is moving too quickly through the House and in a form unlikely to succeed if it gets to the upper chamber. Yet the plan emerged from two key House committees Thursday, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), its top booster, insisted that the pending legislation represents the “only chance we’re going to get” to fulfill the GOP’s long-standing promise to undo the Affordable Care Act. The GOP proposal cleared the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees on party-line votes after marathon sessions that lasted through Wednesday night and into Thursday. It now heads to yet another panel, the Budget Committee, and it remains on track to land on the House floor by month’s end. But the proposal faces challenges with both GOP conservatives and moderates, in addition to Democrats, many of whom questioned the lightning-fast process and raised dueling qualms about its policy provisions. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared to echo a Democratic attack on the House legislation, saying lawmakers need to see the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate of how the bill will affect the federal deficit and the number of insured Americans. “I think we need to know that,” McConnell said at a breakfast sponsored by Politico, adding that the report could be released by Monday. [ Lawmakers take up Obamacare revision without independent scorekeeper ] Trump and Ryan have adopted diverging approaches to critics of the overhaul. While Trump has endorsed the legislation, he has expressed a willingness in recent days to make deals with its critics. But Ryan has emphasized the precarious nature of the legislation House leaders have drafted, all but ruling out substantial changes to the bill before it comes up for a final vote. At an unusual Thursday news conference carried live on cable news channels, a shirt-sleeved Ryan gave a 23-minute presentation. Republicans, he said, face a “binary choice” — vote for the House bill, or let the ACA survive. “We as Republicans have been waiting seven years to do this,” Ryan said. “This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here. The time is now. This is the moment.” Hours later, leaders of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus visited the White House and made a personal case to Trump to modify the legislation — changes that Ryan and other House leaders believe would imperil it by alienating more moderate Republicans. “I didn’t hear anything that said it’s a binary choice at the White House today,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus’s chairman. Meadows declined to detail the changes he and other conservatives are seeking, but they have leveled three broad objections to the Ryan-backed bill: that the system of tax credits it creates constitutes a new government entitlement, that it does not do enough to curtail the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, and that it largely leaves the ACA’s insurance coverage mandates in place. Trump and his deputies have spent the past several days carefully wooing members of the Freedom Caucus with lengthy lunches with the president, calls with staff and friendly meetings with White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, himself a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. It remains unclear when or how any tweaks to the measure would occur. Trump and Ryan both sent strong signals this week that they consider the tax-credit issue settled, and several Freedom Caucus members said they were now focused on beefing up the GOP bill’s attack on the ACA insurance mandates. House leaders involved in drafting the bill largely steered clear of the insurance mandates, having concluded that more significant changes could not get through the Senate. But conservatives said they were not interested in watering down the House bill preemptively. “I think we can probably be more aggressive,” said Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.). “So I think that’s what [Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio] were talking to the president about, saying, ‘Mr. President, if you want to reduce costs, this may not do it.’ ” Another influential House conservative group, the Republican Study Committee, proposed amendments to the Medicaid portion of the GOP plan that would wind down the ACA Medicaid expansion beginning in 2018 rather than 2020, and also require “able-bodied, childless adults” to seek work in exchange for Medicaid benefits. Trump’s willingness to negotiate — expressed in a Wednesday evening meeting with leaders of conservative activist groups and then in Thursday’s session with Freedom Caucus leaders — came amid a barrage of attacks from Democrats and criticism from health-care industry groups. Trump sought to calm fears about the process in an afternoon tweet: “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” The accelerated pace has drawn criticism from Democrats, who contrasted it with the lengthy deliberations that took place before passage of the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans took up that criticism as well. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted early Thursday that the House should “start over.” “Get it right, don’t get it fast,” Cotton wrote from his political account. In a Thursday afternoon interview with The Washington Post, Cotton threw more cold water on the House legislation, including the proposed tax credits to help people pay for insurance. “The bill that was introduced Monday night cannot pass the Senate,” he said. “And I don’t think it will be brought to the Senate for a vote.” Cotton said many of his colleagues hold similar views: “They might not have spoken publicly about it, but I can tell you a number if not a majority of Republican senators think that this process has been too breakneck, too slapdash, and they do not see a good solution for the American people coming out of the House bill as drafted.” Four other GOP senators in states that accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA have expressed concerns about changing the way the program is administered. One of them, Rob Portman of Ohio, reiterated his concerns Thursday after meeting with Vice President Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. “That concerns me if it provides less certainty for the expanded Medicaid,” Portman said. “We’ll see.” The immediate challenge for Trump, however, is getting the legislation through the House, and lawmakers said his meeting Thursday with its most vocal conservative critics showed he is taking a hands-on approach. “We’re appealing to a president who likes to negotiate, who likes to win, and who likes to keep his promises,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), a Freedom Caucus member. After Meadows and the other lawmakers returned from their White House lunch on Thursday, the Freedom Caucus huddled for more than an hour at the Capitol to whittle down a final list of demands. Meanwhile, the American Action Network, a group with close ties to Ryan, said it would launch television ads in more than two dozen media markets urging intransigent conservatives to support the plan. Many House conservatives said they have yet to be swayed. Several said they worry that the White House and Ryan are sending completely different messages about how much influence rank-and-file members will have over the final health care law. “What we hear from the White House is, this is a work in progress,” said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.). “Then we hear from leadership, take it or leave it.” Several members said they’re concerned that promised administrative actions to scale back expensive essential health benefits mandated by the ACA — such as birth control, maternity care and free preventive care — will never materialize if voters balk at the changes. “Given [Trump’s] sensitivity to public opinion, you’re telling me he’s going to make that tough call?” Sanford said. “And, if not, we’re going to own it.” Elise Viebeck and David Weigel contributed to this report.

8.399728104035451e+17	Thu Mar 09 22:54:58 +0000 2017	"A former foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump has written to congressional investigators claiming, without evidence, that his mobile phone may have been tapped last year. Carter Page, a businessman, suggests this would support the view that the Trump campaign headquarters at Trump Tower in New York was under surveillance, since he works nearby and was a frequent visitor there. The president has asserted in a series of tweets that Trump Tower was wiretapped by Barack Obama just before the election but did not explain his basis for the allegation, eventually calling for the House and Senate intelligence committees to investigate. Page, like Trump, has challenged US policy towards Russia and called for warmer relations between the two countries. He visited Moscow last July and December and has not denied meeting the Russian ambassador to the US during last July’s Republican convention, where the Trump campaign successfully lobbied to drop anti-Russia language from the party platform. In a letter addressed to Richard Burr and Mark Warner, chairman and vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Page notes media reports that secret court orders were issued last October to allow the FBI to conduct surveillance of “US persons” in an investigation of possible contacts between Russian banks and the Trump Organization. “Having spoken in favor of some of Mr Trump’s policies on other Fox News Group programs during the 2016 campaign as a campaign surrogate and given the peaceful relationship I have had with Russian citizens since my years in the US Navy, it may be understandable why I would be an associated political target if such sick activities had indeed been committed as alleged in the previously cited media reports,” he writes. “For your information, I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Café, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year. As a sister skyscraper in Manhattan, my office at the IBM Building (590 Madison Avenue) is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.” Page continues: “So if prior media reports may be believed that surveillance was indeed undertaken against me and other Trump supporters, it should be essentially deemed as a proven fact that the American people’s concerns that Trump Tower was under surveillance last year is entirely correct.” He says he keeps his cellphone on at all times except when flying, partly because of a “a chronic medical condition” that requires permanent access to a particular app. In what is presumably a reference to the recent publication of documents by WikiLeaks showing the CIA maintains the technical capability to hack consumer devices, Page adds: “All of this is particularly relevant following recent allegations surrounding surveillance techniques.” The Senate committee will examine Russia’s interference in the election, which intelligence agencies concluded was carried out to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and potential links between Russia and Trump’s associates. The panel has asked about a dozen individuals and organisations, including the White House, to preserve relevant materials. The FBI is also carrying out its own separate investigation. Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of improper contacts and the White House has complained about a “fake narrative” being recycled. Page, an oil and energy industry consultant who has spent significant time in Russia, told the Guardian he would be “more than happy” to testify to the Senate committee. He admitted that he had no proof that his phone was put under surveillance but denied he was attempting to put up a smokescreen, turning his fire instead on the Clinton campaign. “My phone looks clean to me,” he wrote in an email. “More to the point and if they were indeed doing a J. Edgar Hoover-style political attack based on my beliefs, nothing I’ve ever written or said on it could be possibly construed as breaking any U.S. Law ... as per the false evidence and concocted allegations of the Lying Crooked Hillary campaign.” Over the past year the Trump campaign and administration have issued conflicting statements over its relationship with Page. Adam Jentleson, senior strategic adviser at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, has argued , referring to one of Page’s trips to Moscow , the change to the RNC platform and the first batch of DNC emails from WikiLeaks : “Two weeks in July 2016 show why Page could be such an important piece of the puzzle.” "

Bush spoke at neither the 2008 nor the 2012 Republican National Convention. When aspiring successors to his former office mentioned him at all during the primary debates, they cited his legacy as something to avoid repeating. Yet Bush may prove much harder to ignore at the party’s next convention: one of the most mentioned possibilities for the 2016 Republican presidential nominee is the ex-president’s brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Another Bush? How could this be? The answer is that reports of the demise of the Republican establishment have been greatly exaggerated. The outlandish characters who ran for Senate in 2010 and president in 2012 have mostly faded from the scene. The large donors who supported George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney continue to hold sway within their party. Yet observers shouldn’t be misled by the GOP’s back-to-Bush drift. Three big trends have decisively changed the Republican Party over the past decade, weakening its ability to win presidential elections and gravely inhibiting its ability to govern effectively if it nevertheless somehow were to win. First, Republicans have come to rely more and more on the votes of the elderly, the most government-dependent segment of the population -- a serious complication for a party committed to reducing government. Second, the Republican donor class has grown more ideologically extreme, encouraging congressional Republicans to embrace ever more radical tactics. Third, the party’s internal processes have rigidified, in ways that dangerously inhibit its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. The GOP can overcome the negative consequences of these changes and, in time, surely will. The ominous question for Republicans is, How much time will the overcoming take? ELDERLY IN REVOLT Throughout most of their lives, members of the postwar baby-boom generation (now in their 50s and 60s) held views considerably more liberal than those of the generation before them (now in their 70s and 80 "

8.399545939289211e+17	Thu Mar 09 21:42:35 +0000 2017	"At a time when Congress is debating a vast overhaul of the nation’s health care system, a hardened approach to refugees and immigration in general, and links between the current president and interests in Russia, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) finds himself increasingly outside the Beltway, in states and towns won by President Donald Trump . Since January, the Vermont senator has stopped in Mississippi, Kansas and Michigan. Early next week, he’s heading to one of the poorest counties in America, McDowell County, West Virginia, which Trump carried by a ratio of 3-to-1. There, he will tape a show with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. Sanders views these enclaves as critical for the future of the Democratic Party and, by extension, the country. They are, he argues, the places where Democrats have shown “an enormous amount of neglect.” “The truth is, and I think anyone who objectively assesses the situation has to appreciate, that the model the Democrats have followed for the last 10 to 20 years has been an ultimate failure,” Sanders said in an interview with The Huffington Post from his Senate office in Washington. “That’s just the objective evidence. We are taking on a right-wing extremist party whose agenda is opposed time after time and on issue after issue by the vast majority of the American people. Yet we have lost the White House, the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, almost two-thirds of the governors’ chairs and close to 900 legislative seats across this country. How can anyone not conclude that the Democratic agenda and approach has been a failure?” Yuri Gripas/Reuters Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a federal contract workers rally on Feb. 16 to celebrate Andrew Puzder's decision to withdraw from consideration to be secretary of labor. Sanders has also been speaking to crowds outside the Beltway lately. Sanders, of course, is not a Democrat, despite caucusing with Democrats in the Senate for years and running in the party’s 2016 presidential primary. And often his diagnosis of Democrats’ failures strikes those who are in the party as tinged with condescension. But his appeal to a certain class of voters, including those who abandoned the party in favor of Trump, is undeniable, to the point that leadership moved quickly to mirror his playbook and curry his favor. This past summer, the party adopted its most progressive platform ever, with many policies echoing Sanders’ proposals. Following November’s election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave Sanders a spot on his leadership team and endorsed his favored candidate ― Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) ― for Democratic National Committee chairman. But platforms are largely ceremonial. And leadership roles matter little when your party is out of power. So Sanders has adopted what he sees as an “outside strategy” to complement his new status as an inside player. “At the end of the day, being in the minority here in the Senate, the minority in the House, having a right-wing Republican president, the only way we are going to win this ― and I think we can win this ― is when millions of people stand up, especially in states that Trump carried, and say, ‘Excuse me. We did not elect you to be president to throw us off of health care. We did not elect you to cut back on the child care we desperately need,’” he said. As he barnstorms America, much of what Sanders is advocating has a familiar ring. It’s the pitch he’s used for decades and the one that elevated his candidacy during last year’s primary. There is talk of raising the minimum wage, making public universities tuition-free, the need to protect and expand health care access and the encouragement of unionization efforts, including at the Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi. There is a distinctly “ What’s the matter with Kansas? ” feel to it all, premised on the concept that many people who voted for Trump did so against their own self-interest. And Sanders has a theory as to why. Part of it, he explains, is that Trump has effectively turned one set of voters (working-class whites) against another (immigrants and refugees) to the point the real culprits (bottom-line-driven CEOs) skate by without reprimand or punishment. “That’s what demagogues have always done,” he says of Trump. “You pick on the weak and the powerless and you turn a majority against them and you deflect attention from the real causes of the problems that we face.” But there is also a personal element motivating Sanders’ travel too. The crowds he’s drawing aren’t the stadium-sized ones of his primary campaign. But they are the same sets of voters: individuals who left the Democratic Party, may never have associated with it at all or were never politically active in the first place. If Democrats are to regain power ― and if Sanders is to run for the White House again ― success will be predicated on getting this segment of the population engaged. That can be done from D.C., and it can take the form of resistance to Trump. But the bet the senator is making is that it’s more enduring if you go to where the people are with an impassioned, populist pitch. “I think from a moral perspective as well as good politics that you cannot just be defensive,” he said. “You need a proactive agenda that brings people together to fight for a new America.” Video by JM Rieger and Jessica Carro.

8.399414976550175e+17	Thu Mar 09 20:50:33 +0000 2017	"An image of Nefi Flores, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, is reflected in a window of his Los Angeles home. He and his wife have filed a lawsuit against Libre by Nexus, the company that helped bail him out of a detention center. (Stuart Palley/For The Washington Post) Nefi Flores had been in an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Wash., for three months when a fellow inmate told him there was a company that could help him get out. Libre by Nexus was barely a year old. But by the time Flores heard of the company in June 2014, it had grown from a tiny operation in rural Virginia into a booming national business. More than 350,000 undocumented immigrants were detained between Oct. 1, 2015, and Sept. 30, 2016 — a number that could rise this year under President Trump’s immigration crackdown. As asylum seekers, visa violators and those charged with crimes wait for their cases to be heard in badly backlogged immigration courts, thousands are eligible for bail, just as they would be in criminal courts. Yet few can afford it. Libre has found a niche helping them post their bonds — for a price. [ Leer en español ] In exchange for their freedom, immigrants sign contracts promising to pay Libre $420 per month while wearing the company’s GPS devices. But these contracts are the subject of lawsuits and allegations of fraud by immigrants such as Flores who claim they didn’t understand them. In interviews with The Washington Post, a dozen of Libre’s clients said they struggled to pay the monthly fee for the device — which they call a “grillete,” or shackle — and feared if they didn’t, they would be detained again. Most said Libre employees threatened them with exactly that. One asylum seeker said he was so afraid of being sent back to detention that he returned to Honduras, where he is in hiding. Micheal Donovan, Libre’s co-founder and chief executive, disputed those allegations by former clients. He said the company explains its contracts and doesn’t pressure anyone to sign them. He also denied that clients are threatened and said Libre has never returned anyone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to pay. Alt hough some immigrants also report injuries from the GPS devices, he maintained they are safe and fairly priced. “I care about our clients,” he said. “It would be awesome to not have to charge them any money, but that’s not really the system we live in.” Flores had spent his savings fleeing from gangs in El Salvador, with the hope of joining his wife in Los Angeles. After he surrendered to Border Patrol agents in Texas and asked for asylum, ICE sent him to the Northwest Detention Center, a cavernous facility for detained immigrants in Tacoma, and set his bond at $7,500. But Flores was broke. His wife contacted bail bond companies, but they required collateral, such as a car or house, that the couple didn’t have. Flores turned to Libre, a for-profit company whose name means “free” in Spanish. His wife called the company and paid Libre $2,170 — 20 percent of his bond plus fees. Two days later, Flores said in an interview, a Libre employee was waiting for him as he walked out of the detention center, weeping with joy. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) The man drove Flores to a McDonald’s and bought him a Big Mac and a smoothie, he said. Afterward, as they drove to the bus station, the Libre employee pulled into an empty parking lot. The man handed him a packet of documents in English — a language Flores does not speak — and told him in Spanish to sign, Flores recalled. Then, he asked Flores a question. “Where do you want me to put it?” “Put what?” Flores remembered answering. “ La pulsera ,” the man said, using the Spanish word for bracelet. When Flores suggested his wrist, the man scoffed. “I don’t think you’re going to want to walk around with this on your arm,” the man said, pulling out a GPS monitoring device the size of a pack of cigarettes with a thick band. As the man strapped the device to Flores’s ankle, he told Flores he had to pay Libre $420 a month. Flores and his wife were unaware he would have to wear the GPS device, according to a lawsuit the couple filed against Libre last May. They also said they thought the fees would go toward repaying the company for the $7,500 bond. Instead, the money merely compensated Libre for its GPS monitoring services until his immigration case was resolved. Libre called the lawsuit’s allegations unfounded. Few companies have benefited from the country’s broken immigration system like Libre. An unprecedented immigration court backlog of more than 540,000 cases, fueled by the Central American refu­gee crisis and coupled with soaring immigration bond prices, means that many detainees eligible for bail choose between spending many months behind bars or paying Libre’s fees. More than 12,500 have chosen Libre, which contends it is providing a much-needed service. “Without us, there is no one to serve them,” Donovan said. “The [alternative] would be that those people sit in custody.” Its critics argue, however, that the company is making millions of dollars by preying on the very people it claims to be helping. “There is a devil behind the door to liberation,” said Paromita Shah, associate director at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, an immigration rights group. As Libre has expanded, its contracts and tactics have come under increasing scrutiny from immigration lawyers, advocates and elected officials. Both a Guatemalan government official and a California congresswoman have called for investigations, although an ICE inquiry three years ago concluded that the company was not breaking the law. Two lawsuits in California, including a class-action complaint filed last month, could bring new attention to the company’s business practices and the control it wields over the lives of its clients. “I fled from my country,” Flores said, “only to find something here that is even worse.” Micheal Donovan, chief executive and co-founder of Libre by Nexus, talks about the company’s growth inside a mock courtroom at its headquarters in Verona, Va. (Norm Shafer/For The Washington Post) ‘We are the only hope’ With more than 6,500 current clients, 200 employees and nearly 30 offices, including one in El Salvador, Libre by Nexus boasts yearly revenue of more than $30 million. It keeps spinning off new ventures: home rentals, drug and alcohol treatment, legal counseling and work placement. Donovan, who founded the company four years ago with his partner, Richard Moore, said he expects Libre’s clients to double by year’s end. Standing in the parking lot of his company’s headquarters in Verona, 100 miles west of Richmond, Donovan pointed to a mound of dirt where he is planning a $19 million expansion, including “a museum of the American detained immigrant.” He isn’t worried that Libre’s business could be adversely affected by Trump’s promise to build more detention facilities and speed up deportations, he said. In fact, he plans to hire 150 new employees in coming months to keep up with demand. [ She fought deportations. Now she faces that very fate. ] “What we’re going to end up with is internment camps along the Southern border, and people wasting away in them,” he said. “And I know that we are the only hope that a significant number of those people will have. . . . So I’ve got to figure out a way to grow our business to serve more of them.” Donovan and Moore, both 39, met as teens and married last year. They are ex-convicts who became lobbyists, then multimillionaire entrepreneurs. Along the way, Donovan became an ordained minister. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they were repeatedly convicted of writing worthless checks to Virginia businesses and served short stints in a jail. Donovan and Moore don’t try to hide their criminal records. Donovan often cites his own experience with incarceration as the inspiration for Libre by Nexus. In 1999, after Donovan was charged with writing bad checks to four Northern Virginia hotels, he was unable to pay his $45,000 bond. He spent more than seven months in jail before pleading guilty to eight felonies and receiving time served, according to court records. He cites those seven months as the beginning of his interest in the bond process and the criminal justice system. “I went in with no criminal history,” he said. “Now I’m a convicted felon. No one wanted to hire me. I couldn’t even rent an apartment.” Donovan said he turned his life around afterward. But a decade later, he and Moore, who declined to be interviewed for this story, were again accused of financial crimes. In summer 2009, as they volunteered on Democrat Mike Signer’s unsuccessful primary campaign for Virginia lieutenant governor, they rented rooms and office space under assumed names at a Williamsburg hotel and then skipped out on the $25,000 bill. They allegedly did the same thing in at least two other counties, according to police records. After he and Moore served five months for the hotel incident, they launched an enterprise called Project Nexus. They helped post bond for people who couldn’t afford it , put those people in GPS ankle monitors and charged them a fee, although few actually paid it, Donovan said. “We’d try to get their lives on track before they went to court for adjudication and sentencing, hopefully to be able to say to the judge, ‘Look, this person is doing much better. You don’t want to put them in jail,’ ” he said. Although Donovan has described Project Nexus as a nonprofit organization, it never registered as one, a company spokesman acknowledged. Donovan became an ordained minister in 2010, he said, and served as associate pastor of River of Life Ministries in Harrisonburg, Va., from 2012 to 2013. “He really did connect with people,” recalled Cindy Carr, the church’s pastor. “He’s a storyteller.” Both men also began working as lobbyists in Richmond on behalf of the bail bond industry. Donovan represented Bail USA, one of the nation’s largest bail bond companies, and he and Moore helped found the Virginia Bail Agents Association. Among the bills that Donovan championed in the Virginia legislature was HB 728, which would have cut the number of defendants eligible for pretrial services, instead requiring them to post bond. Critics called the bill a boon to bail bondsmen that would clog jails and cost the state money. When the proposed legislation was defeated, Donovan and Moore pushed another version in Colorado, where it appeared on the 2010 ballot as Proposition 102. Donovan headed the “Safe Streets Colorado” campaign, warning a tea party rally about “government-run programs that released violent, heinous, criminal defendants from jail on your tax dollars.” One of the campaign’s ads featured a black-clad criminal breaking into a house and shooting a family. Law enforcement officials denounced Prop 102 , with the Arapahoe County sheriff calling it an “effort to line the pockets of the for-profit bond industry.” Voters overwhelmingly rejected the measure. Donovan and Moore have stopped lobbying on behalf of others. They now employ their own lobbyists, Donovan said, including former Senate majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) . Lott declined to comment for this article. Donovan said Libre is backing immigration reform, including congressional protection for the young adults known as “dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children by their parents. “I employ lobbyists every day that seek to pass legislation that would put us out of business,” Donovan said. “I’m a bit of an enigma that way.” ‘The darkest place’ U.S. Border Patrol agents with a K-9 unit detain undocumented immigrants last year after they illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in McAllen, Tex. (John Moore/Getty Images) Donovan had been running Project Nexus for three years when he had an epiphany. He was talking to a Salvadoran with a relative in an ICE detention center when he learned that the Salvadoran couldn’t pay 10 percent of the bond, as is common in criminal court. Instead, ICE requires immigration bonds be paid in full by someone with legal status in the United States. If an undocumented person tries to pay someone’s bond, then they, too, will be detained. As a result, many undocumented immigrants turn to bail bond agencies. Because they are affiliated with surety companies registered with the U.S. Treasury Department, bail bond companies can post bonds with nothing more than a promise to pay if the person doesn’t show up for court. But few agencies were willing to post immigration bonds because they are riskier and the cases can drag on for years. Donovan dropped what he was doing. “We realized we needed to find the darkest place in the American justice system where the most help was needed,” Donovan said. “And that was immigration.” It was a well-timed switch. Beginning in 2009, the number of pending immigration cases had begun to rise sharply, along with the average wait time for hearings. By April 2013, when Nexus Programs was incorporated, an influx of Central American refugees was driving this backlog to an unprecedented level. There was huge demand for immigration bonds but little supply, and their cost was going up. According to a Post analysis of ICE data, the average cost of a posted immigration bond has risen by more than 70 percent in the past three years, from $5,400 in fiscal 2013 to about $9,300 in 2016. Last year, 12 percent of the country’s detained immigrants — more than 42,000 — found a way to post bond. Because of their felony records, Donovan and Moore aren’t allowed to be bail bondsmen. Instead, the company acts as a middleman, using the ankle monitors to reassure bond agencies that immigrant clients won’t run. When an immigrant’s family pays Libre 20 percent of the bond amount to get the immigrant out of detention, Libre passes along 15 percent to the bond agency, keeps 5 percent and begins charging the immigrant $14 per day for monitoring. Libre rents its GPS devices for $3 a day, according to court documents filed in Georgia. The company said that figure was incorrect, but would not provide the cost. There was no competition, although ICE itself contracts with a private company, BI, to monitor undocumented immigrants with GPS ankle bracelets instead of detaining them. The program, which has grown from 6,000 immigrants in 2013 to about 30,000 today, doesn’t cost immigrants anything. Instead, BI charges the government $4.41 per immigrant per day, according to a 2015 report by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General. ICE spent about $50 million on the program last year. An ICE spokeswoman said the agency has no relationship with Libre and would not comment on its business practices. Eileen Blessinger first noticed Libre in early 2013 when Donovan began appearing in Arlington immigration court on behalf of detained clients. “Donovan was dressed up like a priest in a full black robe and clerical collar,” recalled Blessinger, an immigration lawyer. At first, she didn’t give much thought to the minister and his company. “But then I found out what they were charging,” she said. She and a criminal defense attorney, David Bernhard , went to authorities. Bernhard, who was just appointed as a circuit court judge in Virginia, asked Fairfax County police to investigate the company and said he had clients willing to wear a wire. Fairfax County detectives passed the case to Fairfax City police, who dropped it. Frustrated, Bernhard sent an email on Sept. 18, 2013, to a listserv of criminal defense attorneys that was later forwarded to immigration lawyers. It listed Donovan and Moore’s criminal convictions and their mug shots. A month later, ICE launched its own investigation into Libre, according to records obtained by the Legal Aid Justice Center through a Freedom of Information Act request and shared with The Post. Immigration agents subpoenaed telephone and financial records for Donovan and Moore. They also met in September 2014 with Blessinger. She told them that her clients were “being taken advantage of by Nexus because of their situation,” but “was unable to state what Nexus was doing that was against the law,” according to an agent’s report. “The contracts were signed between Nexus [and] competent adults,” the agent concluded . “The alleged victims . . . may be in a desperate position . . . but there is no evidence to show Nexus is violating any laws under the authority of [Homeland Security Investigations] to investigate.” Allegations of fraud The GPS device that Nefi Flores and other Libre clients wear until their immigration cases are resolved. (Stuart Palley/For The Washington Post) A year after he first felt Libre’s fiber-optic band lock around his ankle, Nefi Flores thought he was nearly free of its grip and the suspicions it generated. A bus driver had spotted it and called ICE. Neighbors assumed he was a criminal. A referee ordered him off a soccer field. Flores learned to wear long pants to hide the device and thick socks under low-cut sneakers to avoid chafing. Above all, he learned to pay Libre by Nexus on time, lest its employees barrage him and his wife with phone calls. With each payment, Flores felt he was closer to the day when he could take it off. By July 2015, he had paid the company more than $7,000 — nearly the full amount of his bond. But when he asked a Libre employee for his balance, she told him it still stood at $7,500. Flores was flabbergasted. When he threatened to stop paying, the woman allegedly told him he could be sent back to jail. Flores sued Libre for fraud last May. Now his allegations are being echoed by two Hondurans who have filed a class-action complaint in U.S. District Court in Northern California. Libre by Nexus, the new lawsuit argues, “preys on detainees’ vulnerability and limited understanding of English to foist crushing financial terms and GPS shackles on detainees.” Asylum seekers Juan Quintanilla Vasquez and Gabriela Perdomo Ortiz, who live in Oakland, Calif., argue they were deliberately misled about what they call the “shockingly bad” terms of contract. “Customers overwhelmingly possess limited or no ability to communicate in, or read, English,” the lawsuit says. “Yet virtually all ‘contract’ documents provided by [Libre by Nexus] are solely in English.” Donovan said employees explain the contracts and that the company has always had forms available in Spanish, although it only began requiring employees to give them to Spanish-speaking clients last year. And he rejected charges that clients were told they would be turned over to ICE if they didn’t pay their fees. “We do not threaten re-detention,” Donovan said, adding that employees who did so would be terminated. Concertina barbed wire tops a fence in Santa Teresa, N.M., along the U.S.-Mexico border. President Trump plans to build a wall along the border, add more detention centers and speed up deportations. (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News) Libre cited specific clients as examples of the company’s positive impact. One of them, José Guzmán, is a 42-year-old Honduran who spent 33 months in an ICE detention center near Los Angeles. He said he was unable to afford his $40,000 bond after being caught driving without a license. He already had a domestic violence conviction. “I spent three Christmases without my kids,” said Guzmán, who learned about Libre in 2014. “I couldn’t care less if they put 10 grilletes on my leg so long as I got to be with my family.” Guzmán said his immigration case remains unresolved, but the company voluntarily cut off his ankle monitor after 18 months, by which time he’d paid around $17,000 in fees. Pierre Laflamme, a Canadian immigrant who lives in Mesa, Ariz., also praised Libre, calling the company “a blessing” after he was detained for a drug conviction and couldn’t afford an $8,000 bond. He said he understood the terms of the contract, but added that the $420 a month was “literally every penny we’ve got.” His immigration hearing is in August, yet Libre’s fees have left him unable to afford an attorney, he said. “They told me about their pro bono legal program,” Laflamme said, “but when I called, they said, ‘Do you have any means to pay?’ When I said no, they sent me to an answering machine, and I never heard back.” Libre’s fees often lead its clients to make painful, panicked choices. Franklin Ortega García owned a small barbershop in Honduras until gang members began demanding a “war tax.” He fled to the United States in 2015 after refusing to pay, turned himself in at the border and asked for asylum. After three months in a detention center, his sister-in-law paid Libre nearly $3,000 to get him out in July 2015. A company employee picked him up outside an ICE facility in Calexico, Calif., and warned him he could be sent back to detention if he didn’t pay the monthly fees, Ortega said. But Ortega made only $150 per week working illegally as a barber near Houston. He was fired from a construction job when undocumented workers spotted his GPS monitor and worried he might attract ICE. Donovan said Libre works with clients who are struggling, sometimes waiving fees. He also said that the company aims to remove clients’ GPS devices within six months to a year. But Ortega paid for more than a year, he said, save for one month when a Libre employee let the fee slide. When he could no longer keep up with the payments, the company began calling his sister-in-law, who had co-signed his Libre contract. Afraid ICE would soon be at his door or his sister-in-law would be forced to pay Libre instead, Ortega caught a Dec. 29, 2016, flight back to the same country where gangs had threatened to kill him. Before heading to the airport, however, he borrowed a friend’s tools. Then he sliced off the GPS device that had haunted him for a year and a half and left it in the trash. “They helped me get out of jail,” he said from Honduras, where he has been moving from one relative’s house to another to avoid the gangs. “But they only freed me so that they could imprison me all over again, and make me work for them.” Cindy Hernandez works in the call center at Libre’s Virginia headquarters. The company expects its clients to double by year’s end. (Norm Shafer/For The Washington Post) Libre disputed his allegations and provided a recorded phone call in which Ortega cited “personal problems” as his reason for leaving the United States. In that same call, Ortega told a company case worker that he had thrown away his GPS device, which Libre values in its contracts at $4,000. “We will have to charge you for that, sir,” replied the case worker, who said he’d talk to his supervisor about Ortega’s case. ‘We’ll be here for you’ When the charger for Leyli Martinez-Perez’s GPS monitor burst into flames, the number she called was not 911. It was Libre by Nexus. When she arrived at Conroe Regional Medical Center near Houston an hour later, it wasn’t in an ambulance, but a car driven by a Libre employee. And when the 25-year-old Salvadoran spoke to doctors about the hand she burned pulling the power cord out of the device, it wasn’t through a hospital interpreter, but her Libre account manager, Wendy Cruz. “Whenever it was time for an examination or something, Wendy told me what to do,” said Martinez-Perez, who spent the night and part of the next day at the hospital receiving treatment. And when Cruz brought a legal document to her bedside, Martinez-Perez again did as she was told, signing away her right to sue the company for her injuries. In exchange, the company agreed not to charge her for six months or put another GPS monitor on her, she said. Martinez-Perez now regrets the deal. She works in a laundromat, where sometimes the steam makes the scar on her hand sting. Meanwhile, hospital bills for about $3,000 keep arriving, and Cruz is not answering her calls, she said. “They told me, ‘We’re going to pay all your medical bills. Whatever you need, we’ll get it for you. We’ll be here for you,’ ” she said. “But when I got out of the hospital, they were nowhere to be found. They were only there when they wanted to charge me.” Cruz referred questions about the incident to Libre, which said the fire was caused by faulty wiring, not its device. The company provided photos of the scorched electrical outlet and the charred charging device. Other Libre clients also complained about their GPS monitors, which they said heat up when they are being charged — an allegation Libre denied. Gabriela Perdomo Ortiz, a pregnant asylum seeker from Honduras, is one of two plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against Libre by Nexus. (Carlos Javier Ortiz/For The Washington Post) Jesus Escobar-Villalta, a 22-year-old asylum seeker from Honduras, said his GPS device began to bite into his ankle not long after his release from ICE custody. Soon, a blister morphed into an infection that swelled his ankle, Escobar-Villalta said. But when he called Libre, the company told him not to go to the hospital because the doctors would cut off the device, he recalled. When his brother finally took him to the hospital, doctors did cut off the device. “I could have lost my foot,” he said. “That’s what the doctors told me.” Like Martinez-Perez, Escobar-Villalta said he signed a document agreeing not to sue Libre in return for a few months of fee forgiveness. And like Martinez-Perez, he said the company hadn’t come through on its promise to pay his $1,500 hospital bill. The company said in an email that its device was not to blame for his hospitalization and that “if the client’s hospital bill wasn’t paid, it was because we never received a copy.” A week after Escobar-Villalta came home from the hospital, Libre employees showed up with another device. “I’m going to have to wear the grillete forever,” he said. “Now it’s on the other foot.” Still fearful For Nefi Flores, his Libre ordeal could be over in a few months. His fraud lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in May. Libre has countersued , claiming breach of contract after Flores stopped sending the company money in August 2015. Although he’s no longer paying, he still wears the GPS device after nearly three years, afraid that he could be arrested for damaging someone else’s property or re-detained if he cuts it off. Flores, who hopes to receive asylum at an immigration hearing in August, works two jobs, often seven days a week, as a valet and in a lamp factory. He’s so busy that he sometimes forgets about the device on his ankle, only to catch it on the door of a car he’s parking or bang it on a piece of machinery. Every night, when he undresses, the sight of it is a reminder of his uncertain future in the United States. And every morning, when he swings his legs out of bed, he feels its weight.

8.399392383931802e+17	Thu Mar 09 20:41:34 +0000 2017	"O n January 29, 5-year-old Sinan al Ameri was asleep with his mother, his aunt, and 12 other children in a one-room stone hut typical of poor rural villages in the highlands of Yemen. A little after 1 a.m., the women and children awoke to the sound of a gunfight erupting a few hundred feet away. Roughly 30 members of Navy SEAL Team 6 were storming the eastern hillside of the remote settlement. According to residents of the village of al Ghayil, in Yemen’s al Bayda province, the first to die in the assault was 13-year-old Nasser al Dhahab. The house of his uncle, Sheikh Abdulraouf al Dhahab, and the building behind it, the home of 65-year-old Abdallah al Ameri and his son Mohammed al Ameri, 38, appeared to be the targets of the U.S. forces, who called in air support as they were pinned down in a nearly hourlong firefight. With the SEALs taking heavy fire on the lower slopes, attack helicopters swept over the hillside hamlet above. In what seemed to be blind panic, the gunships bombarded the entire village, striking more than a dozen buildings, razing stone dwellings where families slept, and wiping out more than 120 goats, sheep, and donkeys. Three projectiles tore through the straw and timber roof of the home where Sinan slept. Cowering in a corner, Sinan’s mother, 30-year-old Fatim Saleh Mohsen, decided to flee the bombardment. Grabbing her 18-month-old son and ushering her terrified children into the narrow outdoor passageway between the tightly packed dwellings, she headed into the open. Over a week later, Sinan’s aunt Nadr al Ameri wept as she stood in the same room and recalled watching her sister run out the door into the darkness. Nesma al Ameri, an elderly village matriarch who lost four family members in the raid, described how the attack helicopters began firing down on anything that moved. As she recounted the horror of what happened, Sinan tapped her on the arm. “No, no. The bullets were coming from behind,” the 5-year-old insisted, interrupting to demonstrate how he was shot at and his mother gunned down as they ran for their lives. “From here to here,” Sinan said, putting two fingers to the back of his head and drawing an invisible line to illustrate the direction of the bullet exiting her forehead. His mother fell to the ground next to him, still clutching his baby brother in her arms. Sinan kept running. His mother’s body was found in the early light of dawn, the front of her head split open. The baby was wounded but alive. Sinan’s mother was one of at least six women killed in the raid, the first counterterrorism operation of the Trump administration, which also left 10 children under the age of 13 dead. “She was hit by the plane. The American plane,” explained Sinan. “She’s in heaven now,” he added with a shy smile, seemingly unaware of the enormity of what he had witnessed or, as yet, the impact of his loss. “Dog Trump,” declared Nesma, turning to the other women in the room for agreement. “Yes, the dog Trump,” they agreed. According to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, the al Ghayil raid “was a very, very well thought out and executed effort,” planning for which began under the Obama administration back in November 2016. Although Ned Price, former National Security Council spokesperson, and Colin Kahl, the national security adviser under Vice President Biden, challenged Spicer’s account, what is agreed upon is that Trump gave the final green light  over dinner at the White House  on January 25. According to two people with direct knowledge, the White House did not notify the U.S. ambassador to Yemen in advance of the operation. A girl stands in the burnt-out remains of a house destroyed during the U.S. Navy SEAL raid in the village of al Ghayil in Yemen on January 29, 2017. Photo: Iona Craig The Intercept’s reporting from al Ghayil in the aftermath of the raid and the eyewitness accounts provided by residents, as well as information from current and former military officials, challenge many of the Trump administration’s key claims about the “highly successful” operation, from the description of an assault on a fortified compound — there are no compounds or walled-off houses in the village — to the “large amounts of vital intelligence” the president said were collected. According to a current U.S. special operations adviser and a former senior special operations officer, it was not intelligence the Pentagon was after but a key member of al Qaeda. The raid was launched in an effort to capture or kill Qassim al Rimi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to the special operations adviser, who asked to remain anonymous because details behind the raid are classified. Villagers interviewed by The Intercept rejected claims that al Rimi was present in al Ghayil, although one resident described seeing an unfamiliar black SUV arriving in the village hours before the raid. Six days after the operation, AQAP media channels released an audio statement from al Rimi, who mocked President Trump and the raid. The White House and the military have denied that the AQAP leader was the target of the mission, insisting the SEALs were sent in to capture electronic devices and material to be used for intelligence gathering. A spokesperson for CENTCOM told The Intercept the military has not yet determined whether al Rimi was in al Ghayil when the SEALs arrived. Although some details about the mission remain unclear, the account that has emerged suggests the Trump White House is breaking with Obama administration policies that were intended to limit civilian casualties. The change — if permanent — would increase the likelihood of civilian deaths in so-called capture or kill missions like the January 29 raid. The village of al Ghayil in Yemen where U.S. Navy SEALs, attack helicopters, and drones launched an operation on January 29, 2017. Photo: Iona Craig T he January mission  was the fourth time U.S. forces have been involved in ground operations in Yemen. While none of those prior raids could be deemed successful — two were failed attempts to free an American hostage, photojournalist Luke Somers — they did not leave the same trail of destruction as the operation in al Ghayil. The village is part of a cluster of settlements known as Yakla in the Qayfa tribal region of Yemen’s al Bayda province. A basic knowledge of the local political environment, combined with a grasp of the obvious challenges posed by the geographical layout of al Ghayil, would have provided substantial forewarning that this latest raid was a highly precarious undertaking. American military planners should have foreseen that their forces would face not only al Qaeda militants, but also heavy armed resistance from residents of al Ghayil and surrounding villages. This area of al Bayda has been at war for more than 2 1/2 years, and the Qayfa tribe is renowned for its fighting prowess and a long-standing refusal to yield to the state. After the joint forces of Yemen’s northern Houthi rebels and military loyalists of the country’s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, seized control of the capital, Sana, in September 2014, they swiftly moved southeast into al Bayda. Most of the Qayfa tribe, including the men of Yakla, have been fighting the Houthi-Saleh forces ever since. Saudi Arabia joined the fray in March 2015, leading a coalition of nations in a military intervention and aerial bombing campaign, supported by the U.S., to push back the Houthis, who the Saudis view as an Iranian proxy force. In theory, the residents of al Ghayil are on the same side as the United States in a civil war that has left more than 3 million people displaced and brought the country to the edge of famine. Al Ghayil, just a few miles from Houthi-Saleh-controlled territory, came under Houthi rocket fire more than once in the early weeks of 2017, leaving the area of Yakla on high alert for attacks and residents in constant fear of losing their homes to a Houthi-Saleh incursion. The closest town, Rada — home to the nearest hospital — had been a no-go area for the population of Yakla since it fell under Houthi-Saleh control in October 2014. When the U.S. Navy SEALs flew into al Ghayil in the early hours of January 29 — a deliberately chosen moonless night — local armed tribesmen assumed the Houthis had arrived to capture their village. After the firefight started, some of the men who ran to defend their families and homes saw colored lasers emanating from the weapons of their opponents, raising suspicions they might be facing Americans. Shortly after the firefight erupted, Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens was shot by a bullet that hit just above his armored chest plate and entered his heart, according to the former senior special operations official briefed on the raid. Owens died shortly after he was hit. Further confusion set in when the attack helicopters joined the assault. Knowing the Houthi-Saleh forces do not have an air force, residents could only assume it was the Saudi-led coalition attacking them from the air. They were not entirely wrong. Troops from the United Arab Emirates — leading players in the coalition’s two-year fight against the Houthis — also took part in the raid and might have been involved in flying the helicopters that fired on civilians. Dozens of UAE Apache gunships are currently stationed in Emirati-run military bases across Yemen. The UAE government did not respond to multiple requests for comment on its role in the raid or answer queries regarding any casualties among its personnel. According to the former senior U.S. special operations official and a current military consultant, both of whom were briefed on the raid, the SEALs discovered by the time they arrived in the village that their operation had been compromised. It is still unclear how those on the ground were tipped off, but a current consultant to the Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees SEAL Team 6, said the command is investigating whether UAE forces involved in the raid revealed the details of the mission before the SEALs arrived in al Ghayil. (However, local residents, who are used to hearing the buzz of drones in the remote area, said they noticed the unusual presence of helicopters around 9 p.m. the night before the raid, which raised concern.) Some men in the surrounding villages grabbed their weapons and ran to help defend their neighbors when they heard the sound of a battle unfolding, according to residents. Mohammed Ali al Taysi, from the nearby village of Husun at Tuyus, dashed to his battered SUV, tearing down a dry riverbed in the dark to reach al Ghayil from the north. But just short of the village, a helicopter flew low overhead, pounding warning shots into the ground on either side of his vehicle. Al Taysi jumped out, firing his rifle toward the Apache before retreating into the night. Other armed men closer to the village descended from the mountainside on foot to support the tribesmen of al Ghayil, who already held the advantage of the high ground on the western side of the village. The SEALs had come in from the low ground to the north, approaching the homes of Abdulraouf al Dhahab and Mohammed al Ameri from the eastern slopes below. According to those present, the firefight quickly escalated around the al Dhahab house, halting the SEALs’ advance. As the U.S. forces fought from the lower ground and more men descended the mountainside to join the shootout, airstrikes obliterated Mohammed al Ameri’s house on the hill above, killing three of his children, ages 7, 5, and 4, and seemingly destroying any possibility of retrieving laptops, hard drives, or other intelligence material from inside without digging through piles of rubble in the dark. With one Navy SEAL dead and two others seriously wounded, the special operations forces began to withdraw. But before they departed, according to local witnesses, the MV-22 Osprey used to extract the retreating soldiers crash-landed, forcing another aircraft to land to pull out the operators. Airstrikes then deliberately destroyed the abandoned Osprey. The gunfight had lasted the better part of an hour. It would be another hour or more before the skies fell silent and the sound of helicopters, aircraft, and drones faded. It was in the dawn light that the mass of bodies was revealed, the missing accounted for, and dead children identified. Smoke swirled into the air from the roofs still burning and the carcass of the smoldering Osprey in the distance. Map of the village of al Ghayil in Yemen’s al Bayda province. Map: The Intercept T his was not the first time residents of the remote Yakla area had lost family members to a U.S. attack. In December 2013, a drone strike on a wedding convoy killed 12 civilians. The groom, Abdallah al Ameri, survived that attack. But on January 29, the 65-year-old was killed standing unarmed beside his house as it was bombed. A picture posted online shortly after the raid showed his body lying in the rocky sand with his hand clasped around a blood-soaked head torch. The aftermath of the raid’s destruction left villagers struggling to understand what the Americans were trying to accomplish. Abdulraouf, whose house appeared to be one of the targets, was no stranger to American attempts to kill him. He was the apparent target of at least three separate airstrikes between 2011 and 2013 in al Bayda province, including one in  September 2012 that killed 12 civilians  — a pregnant woman and three children were among the dead. Following the deaths, Abdulraouf called on the families of victims to hire international lawyers to take their cases to court in the United States. Two of Abdulraouf’s brothers were also killed by American drone strikes as the U.S. was drawn into a long-running bloody feud that had split the family of some 18 brothers between those aligned with al Qaeda and those who stood with the state. Although Abdulelah al Dhahab, a brother who survived the January raid but lost his 12-year-old son, denied Abdulraouf was an al Qaeda member, the bonds between the family and Yemen’s al Qaeda insurgency also extend to marital ties. Al Qaeda propagandist and American citizen Anwar al Awlaki married Abdularouf’s sister. Awlaki’s 8-year-old daughter, Nawar, was in the al Dhahab house the night of the raid. She bled to death after being shot in the neck — the second of Awlaki’s children to be killed by the United States since his own death by an American drone strike in September 2011. His eldest son, 16-year-old Denver-born Abdulrahman, was killed by a U.S. drone two weeks after his father. Following the onset of civil war in March 2015, Abdulraouf played a key role in leading the self-described “resistance” of local armed militias loyal to the Saudi-led coalition, fighting on the pro-government side of Yemen’s internationally recognized president-in-exile, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. As a senior Qayfa tribal figure, Abdulraouf was a well-respected resistance leader. The day before the January raid, he was handing out salaries for pro-government fighters after collecting the money from the nearest Saudi coalition base in the neighboring province of Marib. Although U.S. drone strikes killed a succession of leading AQAP figures in the first six months of 2015, drone, air, and sea-to-land bombings over the preceding 15 years were plagued by poor intelligence and numerous civilian casualties. Survivors of the al Ghayil operation were left to speculate what intelligence led American special operations forces to storm their village “as if they were coming to kill Osama bin Laden,” as one resident noted, puzzling over whether the U.S. thought it was going after the leader of the Islamic State rather than an apparent low-level al Qaeda militant of the same name, Abubakr al Baghdadi, who was killed in the raid. “Or the Americans were tricked into killing Abdulraouf, the leading fighter in Qayfa, to help the Houthis and Saleh,” hypothesized one anti-Houthi tribal fighter. On at least one occasion in Yemen, the U.S. was deliberately fed false intelligence by the regime of then-President Saleh. In May 2010, it resulted in the erroneous killing of the deputy governor of Marib in a drone strike. As one anonymous American official was later quoted as saying, “ We think we got played .” Though the planning for the Yakla operation began many months ago, Abdulraouf’s house in al Ghayil was built recently. The modern cinder-block walls and PVC windows stood out among the simple stone huts dominating the rest of the village. The tribal leader had been living in a tent on the rocky hillside after being run out of the al Dhahab family homestead in the village of al Manasa by Houthi-Saleh forces in the fall of 2014. One resident, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, stated that Mohammed al Ameri’s home was used as a guest house by passing al Qaeda militants — aggressive men whom the rest of the villagers avoided. To get to Mohammed’s house, the SEALs had to pass the al Dhahab home, where Abdulraouf, his brother Sultan, and their guests were holding a late-night gathering with another tribal leader, octogenarian Saif Mohammed al Jawfi, who also died in the raid. The witness claimed the meeting in al Dhahab’s house was held to resolve an issue regarding one of Saif’s relatives who had been arrested by militants connected to the guest house, as well as to arrange the distribution of the U.S.-backed Saudi coalition cash payments to anti-Houthi resistance fighters. Those in the village speculated about the exact target of the January 29 raid. Was the house of Abdulraouf and the tent beside it the objective? Did the U.S. military believe that Qassim al Rimi, the AQAP leader, was inside the house? Or was it the next building on the hillside above, the home of Mohammed al Ameri, the Navy SEALs were aiming for? Others ventured that a woman, Arwa al Baghdadi, might have been the focus. Arwa al Baghdadi, according to her own  social media postings , was imprisoned in 2010 and tortured by authorities in Saudi Arabia after her brother was shot dead by security forces. She was later used as an apparent bargaining chip in the  2015 release of a Saudi diplomat who had been kidnapped by AQAP in Aden three years earlier (Saudi officials say there was no connection). Arwa al Baghdadi, who fled to Yemen after her release from prison, was killed in the raid along with her son Osama, and another brother, Abubakr al Baghdadi. Her pregnant sister-in-law was shot in the stomach. The unborn infant, grazed by the bullet fired into his mother’s stomach, died following an emergency caesarean section at the 26 September hospital, a five-hour drive away in the neighboring province of Marib. Many of al Ghayil’s residents denied any presence of al Qaeda militants in the village that night. Al Rimi’s statement after the raid offered condolences to the families of those killed, and along with AQAP propaganda channels, listed 14 men among the dead, although al Rimi stopped short of calling them AQAP members. (Eight of those names were not included in the toll of the dead that villagers provided to The Intercept, as they were not known to local residents. Family members disputed claims the remaining six men were members of AQAP.) In the current context of Yemen’s civil war, AQAP has sought to frame the conflict as a sectarian struggle against Shiite Houthis. In that narrative, AQAP regularly describes all opponents of the Houthis as Sunni “brothers” or “one of us” — part of a long-term strategy to create a more seamless blend with the local population and tribes. Children stand in the rubble of houses destroyed during a raid by U.S. Navy SEALs in the village of al Ghayil in Yemen on January 29, 2017. Photo: Iona Craig T he only evidence released so far to back up Sean Spicer’s claim that “the goal of the raid was intelligence gathering, and that’s what we received” was a video posted by U.S. Central Command on February 3. CENTCOM presented the clip as confirmation of the “valuable” material collected during the raid and labeled the video as an “AQAP course to attack the West.” But it was quickly taken down after  it was discovered  that the footage was 10 years old — pre-dating the existence of AQAP in Yemen — and was readily available online. The U.S. government has yet to produce any further proof of intelligence collected from the raid. There are other suspect details in the U.S. version of events. In the days after the raid, the  Pentagon claimed  that the women killed were armed and fought the incoming U.S. special operations forces from “pre-established positions.” Yet all of the witnesses to the attack interviewed by The Intercept in al Ghayil strongly challenged this accusation, citing a culture that views the prospect of women fighting, as Nesma al Ameri put it, as “eib” — shameful and dishonorable — and pointing out the practical implausibility of women clutching babies while also firing rifles. A CENTCOM spokesperson refused to provide any details about female fighters to support its assertion. However, the names of the dead that villagers gave to The Intercept did not include one woman listed by AQAP media channels. Propagandists and supporters of the militants claimed one unnamed woman “fought them with her own gun,” with an additional claim that Arwa, the former Saudi prisoner, had thrown a grenade killing a U.S. soldier — assertions strongly denied by Abdulelah al Dhahab, who survived the lengthy gunfight around his brother’s home. Sheikh Aziz al Ameri, the head of the al Ameri clan, lost 20 members of his extended family, six of them children, the youngest only 3 months old. “Everyone who tried to run, they killed them,” he said, standing on the hilltop outside his home 11 days later. In response to The Intercept’s findings, Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project, called for a full investigation into the raid, including the legal basis for the operation, the adequacy of intelligence beforehand, what precautions were taken, and why any precautions failed. “Each new revelation about this tragic operation is grievous and shocking,” Shamsi said. “Even in recognized armed conflict, there are rules to safeguard against the killings of civilians, and even under the Obama administration’s imperfect lethal force policy, which to the best of our knowledge remains in effect, there are constraints that should have prevented or at least minimized civilian deaths.” Last week, the White House announced the Pentagon would be carrying out three reviews of the raid, looking into the death of Owens, the loss of the Osprey, and the civilian casualties. During his first address to Congress on February 28, President Trump noted that Owens died “a warrior and a hero,” leading to a standing ovation for the Navy SEAL’s widow, Carryn Owens. Trump has made no mention of the relatives of the women and children who died that night. By the time the whirring sound of drones returned to Yakla two days after the operation, the village of al Ghayil was largely deserted. With little reason to stay after their livestock had been eradicated, families fled in fear of further attack and imminent enemy takeover following the death of Abdulraouf al Dhahab, Qayfa’s most eminent adversary of the Houthi-Saleh forces. The majority of the men, women, and children who survived are now indefinitely displaced. A month later, amid an unprecedented uptick in U.S. military activity in Yemen last week, the helicopters and drones returned to Yakla. Apaches descended on al Ghayil before dawn on March 2, carrying out “indiscriminate shelling,” according to Sheikh Aziz al Ameri, one of the few residents who remained in the village. Later that day, the Pentagon took responsibility for more than 20 airstrikes carried out in the early hours of the morning across three Yemeni provinces, including al Bayda. Early on March 3, attack helicopters and drones returned yet again. An airstrike, apparently targeting Abduelah, the surviving brother of Abdulraouf al Dhahab, landed just outside the door of his house, killing three of his extended family members from their home village of al Manasa. Late that night, Abdulelah was yet again the apparent target of a drone strike that killed four men traveling with him in a car in Marib province. It is unclear if Abdulelah survived. At least six houses in al Ghayil were damaged the same night by yet more helicopter gunship fire. With the village coming under attack for the third consecutive night on March 5, Sheikh Aziz and his family finally fled; they are now living under trees several miles away. Less than 24 hours later, another drone strike killed two more children, brothers ages 10 and 12. Pentagon spokesperson Capt. Jeff Davis  said in a statement  that the strikes targeting AQAP were conducted in partnership with the government of Yemen and were coordinated with President Hadi. Anti-Houthi resistance fighters on the front lines of the civil war, not far from Yakla, were also killed, according to residents of al Bayda. The following day, Davis told reporters that additional strikes were carried out early on Friday, bringing the total to more than 30 strikes in less than 36 hours — exceeding the 32 confirmed U.S. drone strikes in Yemen during  all of last year . Although Davis stated that “U.S. forces will continue to target AQAP militants and facilities in order to disrupt the terrorist organization’s plots, and ultimately to protect American lives,”  NBC News reported  the strikes were also part of “new directives” to aggressively pursue the Dhahab and Qayfa clans, citing a senior military intelligence source. While the Yakla raid supposedly took place under presidential policy guidelines set up under the Obama administration — standards repeatedly used to defend the U.S. drone program — further developments last week indicate the Trump administration is no longer abiding by the condition of “near certainty” that civilians will not be killed or injured in operations. A defense official  speaking to the Washington Post  stated that the military has been granted temporary authority to regard selected areas of Yemen as “areas of active hostility.” That change, while shortening the approval process for military action, effectively puts the U.S. on a war footing in any area of Yemen designated, but unlikely to be disclosed, by the military, noted Cori Crider, a lawyer at the international human rights organization Reprieve who has represented Yemeni drone strike victims. This authority has a lower bar: Civilian deaths have to be “proportionate” rather than avoided with a “near certainty,” as set out by the previous administration for the use of lethal force “outside areas of active hostilities.” “This means that all of those much-vaunted ‘standards’ the Obama administration said they were using to minimize civilian casualties in drone strikes in Yemen have been chucked right out the window,” said Crider. In a press briefing on March 3, Davis told reporters that the legal authority for carrying out the January raid and recent strikes “was delegated by the president through the secretary of defense” to U.S. Central Command. But when contacted by The Intercept, the Pentagon could not clarify whether al Ghayil was still considered to be outside areas of active hostilities during the botched raid. In al Bayda, the continuing aerial bombardments are perceived by some as helping Saleh and the Houthis — who  last month Spicer conflated with Iran  and accused of attacking an American Navy vessel off Yemen’s western Red Sea coast. The Houthis had, in fact, hit a Saudi frigate. Meanwhile, the villagers of al Ghayil are not calling for the usual tribal standard of compensation for the families of victims. Few wanted to be named saying so, but all expressed the same sentiment less than two weeks after the raid: This time, they want revenge, not a payout. While President Trump continues to hail the mission as a success, quoting Defense Secretary James Mattis in Congress last week that intelligence gathered “will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy,” in Yakla, the clearest outcome appears to be lengthening the list of America’s adversaries beyond al Qaeda. Mohammed al Taysi, the tribesman who tried to join the fight in al Ghayil, put it succinctly as we parted company at dusk along the track out of Yakla. “If they come back,” he said, referring to the SEALs, “tell them to bring their caskets. From now we are ready for any fight with the Americans and the dog Trump.” Iona Craig’s reporting from Yemen was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

First time voter 55-year-old Martha Brawley was interviewed by the New York Times and ABC News   recently. Brawley, a resident of Monroe, North Carolina, said she fears the new Republican health insurance bill will significantly raise her premiums. ""I'm 55. This is the first time in my life I voted, and I voted for Trump hoping that he would change the insurance so I could get good health care,"" she told ABC News. ""I might as well have not voted."" Not to be callous, but “might as well have not voted” is another bad decision on Ms. Brawley’s part. She should have voted for Hillary Clinton if not for anything else but health insurance issues. In Ms. Brawley’s defense, the Republican Party has done a great job of freaking people out about Obamacare, while somehow pretending that the Affordable Care Act was a different thing altogether . Martha Brawley of Monroe, N.C., said she voted for President Trump in the hope he could make insurance more affordable. But on Tuesday, Ms. Brawley, 55, was feeling increasingly nervous based on what she had heard about the new plan from television news reports. She pays about $260 per month for a Blue Cross plan and receives a subsidy of $724 per month to cover the rest of her premium. Under the House plan, she would receive $3,500 a year in tax credits — $5,188 less than she gets under the Affordable Care Act. “I’m scared, I’ll tell you that right now, to think about not having insurance at my age,” said Ms. Brawley, who underwent a liver biopsy on Monday after her doctor found that she has an autoimmune liver disease . “If I didn’t have insurance, these doctors wouldn’t see me.” This is how insidious the Republican Party’s attacks are on the ACA—because they truly have nothing and they are simply playing for power with millions of lives. One of unpopular President Trump’s cabinet picks is Tom Price. Ms. Brawley’s plight, like so many others, is of little interest to this new Secretary of Health and Human Services . Q: Can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on the deficit or result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance? Price: What I can see is that the goal and the desire that I know of the individuals on the Hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal government. The best hope now is that a person like Brawley will continue to vote—but not for the party that continues to spit in the face of its electorate. "

Companies sometimes offer maternity pay, however, only 14 percent of Americans have access to paid family leave,  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . That’s just unrealistic for the modern workforce, said Hathaway, who last year  became a U.N. goodwill ambassador  focusing on parental leave. Low-income workers have even less access to paid leave,  t he Bureau of Labor Statistics  found, as do men. Hathaway spoke poignantly about her own family’s struggles with gender inequality. “My mother had to choose between a career and raising three children, a choice that left her unpaid and under-appreciated as a homemaker because there just wasn’t support for both paths,” she said, noting that because her father was the family’s sole earner, she wasn’t able to spend as much time with him. “The assumption and common practice that women and girls look after the home and the family is a stubborn and very real stereotype that not only discriminates against women, but limits men’s participation and connection within the family and society.”  “How many of us here today saw our dads enough growing up?,” she added. “How many of you dads here see your kids enough now? We need to help each other if we are going to go grow.” Watch her full speech in the video above.

Not all of these issues will top the every voter's list of priorities. But wherever it ranks among public concerns, the 2017 Easter Egg Roll, a tradition since 1878, looms on April 17 as the first big test of the Trump White House's ability to hit the logistical ground running. Because the White House has responsibilities beyond its political agenda, and an administration's ability to staff up and execute are an important test of its functionality.

Over the last 139 years, it has grown from an event with ""a few local children rolling eggs on the White House lawn"" to become the "" largest event held at the White House,"" according to Recreation.gov , a federal government ticketing portal through which White House Egg Roll tickets were awarded last year. If President Trump's history of crowd envy is any guide, he'll want to take note of the numbers that President Obama racked up: Last year's event involved some 37,000 guests; in Obama's first year, 2009, the White House hosted some 32,000 guests. The presence of giant bunnies aside, planning for this behemoth is not to be taken lightly. And the presence of giant bunnies aside, planning for this behemoth is not to be taken lightly.

Programming for each time slot, 7 or 8 stages, 5 consecutive two-hour events, activity zone, sports.""

Rowling reading to one group of kids (something tells us the Harry Potter author won't be there this year) and Shaq shooting hoops with another. Justin Bieber appeared, as did Power Rangers, Joe Jonas, and Troy Aikman. Coordinating all of this effort are 1,000 volunteers, all of whom have to be recruited and screened for security. Then there are also about 30 security checkpoints that have to be manned by Secret Service teams, which requires planning and staffing. As of this week, the first step in the process, the complex ticket lottery, has not yet happened. Though Easter was earlier last year, the ticket lottery had been completed by late February.

(Update 3/8: The White House announced that the Egg Roll is officially scheduled for April 17th. No details about the lottery have yet been released.)

Obama changed the way National Security Agency intelligence is shared 8 days before leaving office, which allows globally intercepted communications to be disseminated across the entire intelligence community. The change was part of a post-9/11 push by the executive branch to increase intelligence sharing, to ensure that NSA analysts do not miss critically important information. The change is “simply widening the aperture for a larger number of analysts, who will be bound by the existing rules,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said at the time. Obama administration officials also scrambled to spread classified intelligence related to Russian meddling in the 2016 election to as many people within the U.S. government as possible. These officials said they spread the intelligence around to ensure Trump administration officials would not be able to quash the investigation. The officials also fought to keep the related intelligence at a low-classified level, giving more officers access to the raw information. “We have people spouting off who don’t know the difference between FISA surveillance and a wiretap or a counterintelligence probe versus a special prosecutor criminal case, and it has hurts our ability to get to the truth and has wrongly created the impression that intelligence officials have a political agenda,” a U.S. intelligence official told Circa Wednesday. These globally-intercepted communications included conversations during the presidential transition between then National Security Advisor-designate Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. These communications were leaked by elements within the intelligence community to the Washington Post, prompting a government scandal and the resignation of Flynn in disgrace. These leaks also likely constitute communications between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence officials, which were reported by the New York Times. “I think President Obama’s behind it, because his people are certainly behind it,” Trump told Fox News in late February. He continued, “some of the leaks possibly come from that group. You know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they’re very bad in terms of national security, but I also understand that’s politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics, and it will probably continue.” Follow Saagar Enjeti on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

8.399179921965711e+17	Thu Mar 09 19:17:08 +0000 2017	"ESPN FC's Herculez Gomez weighs the pros and cons of a 2026 World Cup joint-bid between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. FIFA president Gianni Infantino indicated on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban could prevent the United States from hosting the World Cup. ""It's obvious when it comes to FIFA competitions as well, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup,"" Infantino said. Trump's latest executive order bars new visas for people from six countries and temporarily shuts down America's refugee program, affecting would-be visitors and immigrants from Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya. The United States is mulling a three-way hosting bid with Canada and Mexico. A potential obstacle to the triple hosting is Trump's determination to build a wall on the Mexican border to help stem illegal immigration, with tensions between the countries over who would fund the border barrier. Although the World Cup is nine years away, FIFA expects bidding to begin next year with the host to be decided in 2020. ""The requirements will be clear,"" Infantino said following FIFA meetings in London. ""And then each country can make up their decision, whether they want to bid or not based on the requirements. Nothing to do with the U.S. or not, it's general sporting criterion."" Infantino avoided directly criticizing Trump's policies. ""Mr. Trump is the president of the United States of America and as such of course [I have] huge respect for what he does,""  Infantino said. ""He's in charge, together with his government, to take the decisions that are best for his country. That's why he has been elected."" UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin made a similar observation  to Infantino in a recent interview, but CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani  told ESPN FC that he did not feel that the current U.S. travel ban would negatively affect the bid. FIFA has recently had to deal with the impact of a country restricting visas for one of its events. The FIFA Congress in May has been moved to Bahrain from Kuala Lumpur after Malaysia withdrew from hosting, citing problems allowing entry to some delegates, including officials from Israel. ""In the world there are certainly many countries who have bans, travel bans, visa requirements and so on and so forth,"" Infantino said. "

The episode, part of a series called Believer with Reza Aslan, was shown on Sunday and provoked horror and dismay from many viewers and an angry backlash by Hindus in America. Tulsi Gabbard, the only Hindu in Congress, tweeted: 'I am very disturbed that CNN  is using its power and influence to increase people’s misunderstanding and fear of Hinduism.'   CNN's Reza Aslan (pictured, right) has been heavily criticized for eating human brain in an episode of his new series called Believer Aslan tastes what was presented to him as cooked human brain tissue. A member of the sect threatened to cut his head off at one point if he asked too many questions  Aslan, an Iranian-born religious scholar, was with a group from the Aghori sect when he was invited the human tissue during a ritual The Democrat, from Hawaii, added: 'Aslan apparently sought to find sensationalist and absurd ways to portray Hinduism. 'Aslan and CNN didn't just throw a harsh light on a sect of wandering ascetics to create shocking visuals - as if touring a zoo - but repeated false stereotypes about caste, karma and reincarnation that Hindus have been combating tirelessly.'  Aslan, an Iranian-born religious scholar, was with a group from the Aghori sect when he was invited to eat cooked brain tissue during a ritual. Aslan, 44, met the Aghori in the holy Hindu city of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, where they smeared the ashes from cremated human bodies on his face.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a US Army major who serves in the Hawaii National Guard, said she was 'very disturbed' by CNN using its influence to tarnish the good name of Hindus He then drank an alcoholic drink from a human skull, before eating what he was told was human brain. At one point he fell out with the Aghori guru who shouted: 'I will cut your head off if you keep talking so much.' The guru began eating his own faeces and then hurled it at Aslan. Aslan quipped: 'I feel like this may have been a mistake.'  He later posted on Facebook: 'Want to know what a dead guy's brain tastes like? Charcoal'.  'It was burnt to a crisp!'   Indian-Americans have criticized CNN for highlights the beliefs of a tiny cult - which has less than 100 members - which has little to do with mainstream Hinduism. The Aghori are devotees of the Hindu god Shiva and believe nothing can taint the human body. But their beliefs and practices are rejected by orthodox Hindus.  The Hindustan Times reported that the US India Political Action Committee said in a statement: 'With multiple reports of hate-fueled attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterizes Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world.'  Aslan (pictured, right) has been criticized for 'sensationalist' reporting. The Aghori (pictured, left) number less than 100 and their beliefs and practices are frowned upon by a billion Hindus Industrialist Shalabh Kumar told the Press Trust of India: 'This is a disgusting attack on Hinduism'. Kumar tweeted: 'CNN, Clinton News Network has no respect for Hindus. All Hindus worldwide should boycott CNN.' He also claimed the Republican Hindu Coalition was 'planning to take major action'. Then, in an extraordinary outburst, Kumar tweeted: 'I condemn CNN for airing Believer with fiction. Disgusting attack on Hindus for supporting @POTUS @stephenkbannon @newtgingrich.' Kumar had previously claimed that 65 percent of Hindus in America had voted for Trump.  Aslan refused to apologize for the episode and on Twitter seemed to be positively reveling in the controversy Sanjay Puri, chairman of the United States India Political Action Committee, said: 'We are very disappointed. This is an issue that is of deep concern to the Indian-American community evidenced by the large number of calls/emails we have received.  'In a charged environment, a show like this can create a perception about Indian-Americans which could make them more vulnerable to further attacks'.   But there is no sign of an apology from Aslan, who seems to be revelling in the controversy. One of the Aghori sect members appears to threaten Aslan during the episode He retweeted an article by the American Council on Science and Health which was headlined: 'Why CNN's Reza Aslan Shouldn't Eat Human Brains' and then tweeted: 'You work all your life for a headline like this.' But on his Facebook page Aslan, writing about the episode, said: 'As I repeatedly state on camera and in voice-over, (they) are not representative of Hinduism but are instead an extreme Hindu sect who reject the fundamental Hindu distinction between purity and pollution.'  Aslan, who is himself a Muslim, is the author of several books, including No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam.  "

8.39912632832385e+17	Thu Mar 09 18:55:51 +0000 2017	"A Republican proposal to ­revise the Affordable Care Act claimed its first major victories Thursday amid a backlash that both Republican leaders and President Trump spent the day trying to tamp down. Trump met with conservative critics of the plan, signaling both a willingness to negotiate its details and that it does not yet have enough votes to emerge from the House. More acknowledgment of the proposal’s problems came from Senate Republicans, who suggested Thursday that the measure is moving too quickly through the House and in a form unlikely to succeed if it gets to the upper chamber. Yet the plan emerged from two key House committees Thursday, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), its top booster, insisted that the pending legislation represents the “only chance we’re going to get” to fulfill the GOP’s long-standing promise to undo the Affordable Care Act. The GOP proposal cleared the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees on party-line votes after marathon sessions that lasted through Wednesday night and into Thursday. It now heads to yet another panel, the Budget Committee, and it remains on track to land on the House floor by month’s end. But the proposal faces challenges with both GOP conservatives and moderates, in addition to Democrats, many of whom questioned the lightning-fast process and raised dueling qualms about its policy provisions. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared to echo a Democratic attack on the House legislation, saying lawmakers need to see the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate of how the bill will affect the federal deficit and the number of insured Americans. “I think we need to know that,” McConnell said at a breakfast sponsored by Politico, adding that the report could be released by Monday. [ Lawmakers take up Obamacare revision without independent scorekeeper ] Trump and Ryan have adopted diverging approaches to critics of the overhaul. While Trump has endorsed the legislation, he has expressed a willingness in recent days to make deals with its critics. But Ryan has emphasized the precarious nature of the legislation House leaders have drafted, all but ruling out substantial changes to the bill before it comes up for a final vote. At an unusual Thursday news conference carried live on cable news channels, a shirt-sleeved Ryan gave a 23-minute presentation. Republicans, he said, face a “binary choice” — vote for the House bill, or let the ACA survive. “We as Republicans have been waiting seven years to do this,” Ryan said. “This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here. The time is now. This is the moment.” Hours later, leaders of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus visited the White House and made a personal case to Trump to modify the legislation — changes that Ryan and other House leaders believe would imperil it by alienating more moderate Republicans. “I didn’t hear anything that said it’s a binary choice at the White House today,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus’s chairman. Meadows declined to detail the changes he and other conservatives are seeking, but they have leveled three broad objections to the Ryan-backed bill: that the system of tax credits it creates constitutes a new government entitlement, that it does not do enough to curtail the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, and that it largely leaves the ACA’s insurance coverage mandates in place. Trump and his deputies have spent the past several days carefully wooing members of the Freedom Caucus with lengthy lunches with the president, calls with staff and friendly meetings with White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, himself a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. It remains unclear when or how any tweaks to the measure would occur. Trump and Ryan both sent strong signals this week that they consider the tax-credit issue settled, and several Freedom Caucus members said they were now focused on beefing up the GOP bill’s attack on the ACA insurance mandates. House leaders involved in drafting the bill largely steered clear of the insurance mandates, having concluded that more significant changes could not get through the Senate. But conservatives said they were not interested in watering down the House bill preemptively. “I think we can probably be more aggressive,” said Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.). “So I think that’s what [Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio] were talking to the president about, saying, ‘Mr. President, if you want to reduce costs, this may not do it.’ ” Another influential House conservative group, the Republican Study Committee, proposed amendments to the Medicaid portion of the GOP plan that would wind down the ACA Medicaid expansion beginning in 2018 rather than 2020, and also require “able-bodied, childless adults” to seek work in exchange for Medicaid benefits. Trump’s willingness to negotiate — expressed in a Wednesday evening meeting with leaders of conservative activist groups and then in Thursday’s session with Freedom Caucus leaders — came amid a barrage of attacks from Democrats and criticism from health-care industry groups. Trump sought to calm fears about the process in an afternoon tweet: “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!” The accelerated pace has drawn criticism from Democrats, who contrasted it with the lengthy deliberations that took place before passage of the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans took up that criticism as well. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted early Thursday that the House should “start over.” “Get it right, don’t get it fast,” Cotton wrote from his political account. In a Thursday afternoon interview with The Washington Post, Cotton threw more cold water on the House legislation, including the proposed tax credits to help people pay for insurance. “The bill that was introduced Monday night cannot pass the Senate,” he said. “And I don’t think it will be brought to the Senate for a vote.” Cotton said many of his colleagues hold similar views: “They might not have spoken publicly about it, but I can tell you a number if not a majority of Republican senators think that this process has been too breakneck, too slapdash, and they do not see a good solution for the American people coming out of the House bill as drafted.” Four other GOP senators in states that accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA have expressed concerns about changing the way the program is administered. One of them, Rob Portman of Ohio, reiterated his concerns Thursday after meeting with Vice President Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. “That concerns me if it provides less certainty for the expanded Medicaid,” Portman said. “We’ll see.” The immediate challenge for Trump, however, is getting the legislation through the House, and lawmakers said his meeting Thursday with its most vocal conservative critics showed he is taking a hands-on approach. “We’re appealing to a president who likes to negotiate, who likes to win, and who likes to keep his promises,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), a Freedom Caucus member. After Meadows and the other lawmakers returned from their White House lunch on Thursday, the Freedom Caucus huddled for more than an hour at the Capitol to whittle down a final list of demands. Meanwhile, the American Action Network, a group with close ties to Ryan, said it would launch television ads in more than two dozen media markets urging intransigent conservatives to support the plan. Many House conservatives said they have yet to be swayed. Several said they worry that the White House and Ryan are sending completely different messages about how much influence rank-and-file members will have over the final health care law. “What we hear from the White House is, this is a work in progress,” said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.). “Then we hear from leadership, take it or leave it.” Several members said they’re concerned that promised administrative actions to scale back expensive essential health benefits mandated by the ACA — such as birth control, maternity care and free preventive care — will never materialize if voters balk at the changes. “Given [Trump’s] sensitivity to public opinion, you’re telling me he’s going to make that tough call?” Sanford said. “And, if not, we’re going to own it.” Elise Viebeck and David Weigel contributed to this report.

He saw no need to delay the victory speeches, having been up since before daybreak orchestrating a statewide get-out-the-vote operation for what was expected to be a close contest. His team took the elevator to the rooftop bar, where about 50 small farmers gathered anxiously to watch the returns and, they hoped, celebrate. For the previous 14 months, they had battled a so-called “right to farm” ballot initiative, with Maxwell serving as “the general” (to quote his friends) of that campaign. Corporate agricultural interests in Oklahoma hoped the measure would protect factory farming from environmental, food safety and humanitarian regulations. The deep-red state’s Republican governor and every member of its all-GOP congressional delegation backed it. In response, Maxwell, who works for the Humane Society,  had helped assemble an opposition force of animal welfare activists, environmental groups, Native American tribes and family farmers. Few political strategists would have picked that coalition to overcome the influence of the state’s dominant industry . But there Maxwell was, quietly enjoying a beer as he listened to former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson (D) deliver the news of their crushing victory to a cheering audience. The “no” vote had carried every congressional district in the state and defeated Big Ag by more than 20 points. Maxwell slapped a few backs, shook a few hands and made small talk about the view of Oklahoma City’s modest skyscrapers. The party broke up early, as people relocated to await the presidential returns. Maxwell and a few of his top deputies retreated to a bar down the street. Not many Democrats enjoyed the evening of Nov. 8, 2016. A bit after 10 p.m., Maxwell called Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Program at the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C., to complain that he had no one to celebrate with. Democrats don’t have to throw out their values. Democrats don’t even have to abandon their issues. Joe Maxwell Donald Trump ’s triumph last November was a victory for rural and small-town voters over metropolitan enclaves, the culmination of a  grim trend for Democrats that has been intensifying since the 1990s. In 1996, Bill Clinton won nearly half of America’s 3,142 counties. Sixteen years later, Barack Obama carried fewer than 700 counties  and still won the election. Hillary Clinton carried just 487 and lost. Running up the score in population centers isn’t helping much with down-ballot contests either. As culturally liberal people move away from suburban and rural communities and concentrate themselves in cities , they’ve increased the Democratic Party’s margins in already blue areas — but decreased them in swing suburban, exurban and rural districts. At the same time, Republicans have  aggressively gerrymandered many previously competitive districts, redrawing them to neutralize Democratic votes. Those two factors make it extremely difficult going forward for Democrats to win the U.S. House of Representatives, where they’ve shed 69 seats since 2008, or state legislatures, where they’ve ceded more than 900 seats over the same stretch, without revitalizing their position in exurban and rural America. After the 2016 disaster, Democrats tasked Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) with performing an independent “autopsy” of the party’s disappointing performance in House races across the country. His team conjured a 350-variable mathematical model, studying hundreds of districts. The massive resulting equation predicts doom for Democrats in districts with few college-educated voters, but sees promise in wealthier, diversifying suburbs. It suggests a strategy that effectively writes off all of rural America. “They’re just wrong,” Maxwell said. “They can’t do that, and they don’t have to.” Maxwell’s brand of politics looks beyond the poll-tested analytics that dominate Washington. Even the best mathematical models — tools like Maloney’s current project — are only useful at a particular snapshot in time. They treat voters as static data points, rather than human beings capable of changing their minds. A model might focus on the number of Democrats registered in a district to predict the party’s performance in an upcoming race. But models can’t explain how to create more Democrats in that district. Maxwell won where Democrats weren’t even playing, in a state where Trump carried every single county. When he convinced the Humane Society to get involved against the right-to-farm measure in 2015, independent polling showed his side trailing 64 percent to 15 percent. His decision to fight and battle plan reveal a possible path for the Democratic Party out of the political wilderness and back to electoral relevance. But taking it would require rejecting the political strategy that Democratic leaders are now honing in Washington. “Democrats don’t have to throw out their values,” Maxwell insists. “Democrats don’t even have to abandon their issues. It’s about how you frame it. It’s about connecting with people and showing them how your ideas fit with their values.” Alissa Scheller/The Huffington Post Maxwell, 59, and his brother Steve run a farm in northeastern Missouri, just outside the town of Mexico, with a population of roughly 11,000. They’re fourth-generation hog farmers, and politics wasn’t a focus growing up. After stints in the Army and the U.S. Postal Service, Maxwell returned to the family business in the late 1970s, just in time for Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s crusade against inflation. The Fed’s ruthless interest rate hikes didn’t just bring down prices; they devastated small farmers, sparking a great wave of farm foreclosures across the country. When the farms failed, so did the local community banks that had loaned them money. And when the banks collapsed, so did other local businesses that relied on them for credit. Rural America was ravaged. Farmers rode tractors into Washington to snarl traffic in protest, and Maxwell decided to go into politics. “That’s when I realized that government actions pick winners and losers,” he said. “And they’d decided that my industry was a loser.” Maxwell began volunteering for Rep. Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.), and by 1986 he was working on the presidential campaign of Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.). He helped Gephardt organize his ultimately unsuccessful opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement before striking out on his own. Maxwell won election first to the Missouri legislature and then as the state’s lieutenant governor in 2000 — another year when his win bucked a bad national trend for Democrats. “I’m pretty good at getting up and giving a line to people on the stump,” said Wes Shoemyer, a former Missouri state senator. “Me personally, I’m just a good ol’ boy, not too sophisticated. Joe, he’s a sophisticated good ol’ boy. And that’s something the Democrats lost.” Statewide Democratic campaigns in Missouri typically set up shop in Democratic-friendly cities like St. Louis or Kansas City.  Maxwell ran his campaign for lieutenant governor from his hometown , which meant he didn’t have to sit through city traffic every time he set out to stump in rural Missouri. Working adjacent to a farm did have its drawbacks, however. “We were in an at-times flea-infested office,” recalled Tricia Workman, a Missouri-based lobbyist who managed the campaign. “I probably paid to exterminate them myself. But he campaigned on agriculture, which is the state’s biggest industry.” “And he campaigned on health care, the working class, the middle class — everybody gets a quality education,” she said. “And we won on that. ... Democrats used to be a lot more popular in the state.”  Michael Cali for The Huffington Post To win over voters, Maxwell argues, ""you have to go be where they are ... and [show] them that you are like them, that you share their values."" Maxwell still speaks lovingly of “Jeffersonian democracy” and hails Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. There’s a harmony between his attacks on corporate farm interests and the rhetorical assaults from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) against the 1 percent. But Maxwell and his allies aren’t selling democratic socialism. “We don’t want government subsidies,” said Fred Stokes, a Maxwell collaborator who founded the Organization for Competitive Markets , which advocates for small farms against big producers like Tyson, Perdue and Smithfield. “We just want the game to be fair. Apply the damn antitrust laws and it’ll work. Teddy Roosevelt had this figured out 100 years ago. I don’t know why it’s so damn hard for people to understand.” The work that Maxwell and the Humane Society of the United States are doing in rural America could serve as a foundation for further outreach. The Humane Society’s battles against factory farms, puppy mills, research labs and other places that abuse animals are nonpartisan. Its advocates are Democratic and Republican alike, and its explicit political organ, the Humane Society Legislative Fund, supports candidates from both parties. But many of the alliances it has built look like the nascent stage of a new rural liberalism. In 2010, the group’s president, Wayne Pacelle, was in Jefferson City, Missouri, to lobby in favor of a state ballot proposal to crack down on puppy mills. He ran into Maxwell at the statehouse. “It was a pure case of serendipity,” Pacelle said.  Maxwell had backed a bill to ban cockfighting during his time in the state legislature, and he’d gone after Big Ag for animal cruelty before. Pacelle hired him to direct the Humane Society’s rural outreach program. Connecting with farmers as an animal welfare advocate requires overcoming some significant cultural barriers. A lot of farmers see the Humane Society’s efforts against animal cruelty as a Trojan horse — the first step in a project that ends with forced vegetarianism and the elimination of all animal agriculture. “What people may not realize about places like Oklahoma is, yes, there is a huge agricultural industry, mostly wheat and cattle,” said F. Bailey Norwood, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. “But ag is also a very popular hobby. … For a lot of kids growing up, their hobby was showing cattle or showing hogs. They show farm animals the way other people show dogs. So even when people don’t farm for a living, there’s a real connection with farm culture.” “With my students, there’s a lot of us-versus-them mentality,” he said. “Us, the good Oklahomans who raise our animals right, and them, these crazy animal rights activists and environmentalists from California who wanna tell us what to do.” Stokes, the small-farmers advocate, acknowledged that  Maxwell’s association with the Humane Society is a significant cultural barrier . “All of us catch a lot of hell for that,” Stokes said. “They’ve been conditioned by Farm Bureau and everyone else over the years to think badly about the Humane Society, when they’ve been very good to us and asked for absolutely nothing in return.” (The American Farm Bureau Federation is a century-old organization that advocates for the agricultural industry, but tends to represent the goals of Big Ag.) But there is a common interest between family farmers — who are routinely undercut by the market power of big meat-packing companies — and animal welfare advocates — who want to end brutal factory farming techniques that small farms, by definition, don’t deploy. And Maxwell is getting results. Back in 2002, when he was still lieutenant governor, the Humane Society helped pass an anti-cockfighting ballot initiative in Oklahoma. But it did so by getting strong turnout in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Initiative supporters carried only 11 of the state’s 77 counties. On the 2016 right-to-farm question, Maxwell’s side won 37. “You have to go meet them,” said Maxwell, referring to voters. “You have to go be where they are. It’s about who they are and showing them that you are like them, that you share their values. If you’re in their coffee shop or barber shop or their synagogue or their church — if you’re there, then they feel comfortable to express themselves. You can’t do that in a poll.” The Humane Society’s success at state-level politics has earned it a lot of enemies. Major food and agriculture companies hired PR guru and super-lobbyist Rick Berman to target the Humane Society with a complex propaganda operation. Berman is behind both the think-tank-sounding Center for Consumer Freedom and the blog HumaneWatch.org, which has visually caricatured Maxwell as a puppet and falsely smeared him as an animal torturer. “HSUS is a vegan organization — they don’t want people to ultimately eat meat,” Will Coggin, research director for the Center for Consumer Freedom, claimed. “If they want to be like PETA, they should be as honest as PETA is about their agenda.” This charge is, of course, impossible to square with Maxwell’s career as a hog farmer.  “I represent Monsanto, which Joe hates, but I still have the absolute biggest respect for him that I possibly could, as a human being and as a politician,” said Workman, his former campaign manager who has since returned to lobbying. rayna via Getty Images Farmers across the country are not monolithic in their political views. While Maxwell is notching victories now, any broader Democratic Party strategy for rural America would take time to pay off. But he didn’t win the first one either. In 2014, when Maxwell decided to fight a right-to-farm ballot initiative in Missouri, Big Ag had a 35-point lead. Maxwell’s side ended up losing the vote by a whisper-thin 0.2 percent. Former Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Muegge (D) took note. When a similar plan was introduced in Oklahoma, he called Maxwell and urged him to join the opposition campaign, which was headed by Cynthia Armstrong, the Humane Society’s top operative in the state. Right-to-farm measures come with a sympathetic label, but they benefit big agricultural conglomerates, giving them legal protections that help elbow smaller producers out of the market. The Oklahoma initiative would have amended the state constitution to make it all but impossible for the state government to regulate farming technology, either by statute or agency rules. Unless the government could demonstrate “a compelling state interest” — an extremely high standard of legal scrutiny that also applies, for example, to restrictions on voting rights — new farming rules would be forbidden. Even if the state could show a compelling interest, corporate agriculture could have used the right-to-farm law to tie up new standards in court for years. Maxwell was tasked with everything from writing speeches to pitching farmers face-to-face on the “no” campaign. “The farm community is so much faith-based, I thought the idea of stewardship could really be a powerful message,” Maxwell said. “Stewardship of the animals, stewardship of the land.” He also saw an opening on environmental concerns, which are paramount in many portions of the state. The Illinois River, Lake Tenkiller and other waterways in eastern Oklahoma have been polluted for years, due primarily to chicken waste runoff from big poultry farms. Eastern counties broke hard for Maxwell’s side on election night. “I think Joe’s an amazing person,” said Mike Callicrate, a Kansas cattle rancher who serves on the board of the Organization for Competitive Markets. “And it’s going to be his work and his coalition-building that will save family farming and get people back to the land. That win in Oklahoma might be the turning point.” Victory builds confidence. Maxwell spent this past New Year’s Eve in his hometown with brother Steve and former lawmaker Shoemyer. In deep-red northeastern Missouri, one of the bars on the town square displayed a sign declaring that anyone who had voted for Hillary Clinton would not be served.  Maxwell’s crew took the hint and started their evening on the other side of the square. After a few rounds, his drinking buddies looked up to see him walking toward the anti-Clinton sign. Maxwell walked in, slammed his hand down on the bar and said, “I voted for Hillary Clinton and I want a beer!” Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

8.399081982745027e+17	Thu Mar 09 18:38:13 +0000 2017	"What should we make of the House Republican health-care proposal released this week? It has certainly been off to a difficult start. And I suspect that in a week’s time its authors will look back fondly on that difficult start as the glorious interlude before the Congressional Budget Office had scored the proposal. There are rough waters ahead. But this process is far from over.  It is an old political truism that a successful compromise is an outcome no one likes. But that surely doesn’t mean that any proposal no one likes must be a good idea or a plausible compromise. The House Republicans have managed to propose an approach to health reform that almost no one really likes.  So how did that happen? And where is this process likely to go? Stipulating at the outset that I sure don’t know, I have a few conjectures. First, it’s important to recall how legislative endeavors like this, and particularly regarding health care, tend to work. In very general terms, the House establishes the framework and the Senate fills it in. As we have seen most recently with Obamacare and (on a smaller scale) with the 2015 Republican reconciliation bill that sought to repeal Obamacare, the Senate tends to respond to House bills like these with wraparound amendments that essentially replace the substance of the bill with a version more suited to Senate procedure—and frequently also more developed and cooked. You might say the House writes the chapter headings and the Senate writes the text. I would expect that to happen here. But the way the House begins the process obviously matters enormously, and in this case things are not off to a very good start.  If the House is writing the framework, what are its basic elements? The House proposal involves two fairly distinct sets of reforms: an aggressive and appealing Medicaid reform that conservatives (and a few prominent liberals too) have sought for 20 years, and a set of incremental individual-market reforms that have some real trouble holding together.  The Medicaid reform, which would gradually bring to an end the federal-state “match” approach to Medicaid funding that has done enormous harm to American health care and federalism for decades, is very worthwhile. It would replace that match approach with a capped federal contribution, based on the size of the beneficiary population (or more precisely, several beneficiary sub-populations) in each state. There is room for debate about the growth-rate of such a capped contribution, and there would be such room in an ongoing way in this sort of system, as well as for thinking about how to handle the transition to that system given that some states have expanded Medicaid eligibility in the last few years under a much higher federal match and others haven’t. I don’t love all the details of the House proposal on all those fronts, but they are clearly subject to negotiation.  That kind of negotiation and renegotiation is appropriate and unavoidable, and it would be best entered into with a default inclination to be protective of vulnerable people and to be willing to accept higher near-term spending levels in return for enduring structural reforms. But this reform is an excellent idea on the whole, and it is very encouraging to find it here and to see Republicans largely united in support of it. It’s surprising, too. Until the last few weeks, I would not have guessed that what Republicans put forward to take on Obamacare would advance a transformation of Medicaid’s funding system to per-capita caps. This reform would be, in some respects, more significant than anything else the House bills would do.  The individual-market reforms are another story. Some of them are a kind of twisted, fun-house mirror version of an approach to the federal role in the individual insurance market that has been proposed by some conservatives for years, but a number of the twists are peculiar and problematic. These twists have been explained by some this week as a function of the longstanding divisions about health-care policy on the Right, and there is surely some truth to that. But the House approach actually very clearly takes a side in that longstanding fight. It takes the side of the refundable tax credit camp, and isn’t particularly shy about it. Some of its problems—like the credit being means tested at the top but not the bottom, leaving it not helpful enough to people just above the new Medicaid thresholds—are probably a function of trying to make the bill a little more palatable to critics on the Right. But as a general matter, it doesn’t twist itself in knots over the basic question of the tax-credit approach.  The twists, it seems to me, are much more a function of a different problem: The proposal has the form it does because it isn’t quite sure how aggressive to be about the Senate’s procedural rules. It is being pursued through the budget reconciliation process to avoid a Senate filibuster, which means that in the Senate it has to survive the Byrd Rule that requires each element of the bill to be relevant to the budget. That means pure tax and spending measures are allowed, but pure rules changes—like reforms of insurance regulations—may not be unless they are deemed by the Senate parliamentarian (or the presiding officer) to have clear budget implications. And there is a vast gray area in between.  The House Republican proposal has clearly been designed with a very specific set of assumptions in mind about what can make it past the Byrd Rule in the Senate and what cannot. But it’s less clear where these assumptions come from or how valid they are. Some of them are downright strange. The bill assumes that Obamacare’s core feature—the federalization of health insurance—cannot be undone through reconciliation. So it does what it does within the boundaries of Obamacare’s imposition of specific guaranteed-issue and community-rating rules on the insurance system. But some of Obamacare’s insurance regulations, like the premium age bands (that determine how much higher the premiums of older people may be than those of younger people) are altered in the House proposal. And the proposal also introduces some elements, like a 30 percent surcharge on premiums for people who haven’t been continuously insured, which seem (to me) very unlikely to survive a Byrd Rule challenge.  This inconsistency about the limits of reconciliation strikes me as the source of the bill’s core structural strangeness. The conservative reforms on which it is modeled (like Tom Price’s bill, Paul Ryan’s past proposals, the Hatch-Burr bill in the Senate, and various conservative wonk ideas in the Obama years) were premised on a repeal of Obamacare, or were proposed before it was enacted.  Those various proposals all involved bringing premium costs down by enabling insurers to sell catastrophic coverage plans (along with more comprehensive plans) and enabling everyone in the individual market to afford at least those catastrophic coverage plans. This would enable far greater competition and let anyone not otherwise covered by insurance enter the individual market as a consumer.  That would be achieved, first, by freeing insurers from the benefit and design mandates of Obamacare and returning almost all health-insurance regulation to the states. The main exception is that those past proposals would require that people with continuous insurance coverage be allowed to keep their plans (and to an extent to switch to new ones) without being newly risk-rated. This would create a strong incentive for healthy people to purchase coverage.  And second, those kinds of proposals would provide a refundable tax credit for the purchase of coverage and enable—or in some cases require—insurers to offer some plans with premiums equal to the amount of the credit (with deductibles and other cost sharing adjusted accordingly). This would mean that people could get catastrophic coverage for extreme expenses for the same price they now pay to be uninsured—i.e., nothing.  The combination of these features would mean that everyone could afford to purchase at least catastrophic coverage in a competitive individual insurance market, and there would then be a wide range of options above that and real downward pressure on premium costs. The credit would be paid for by a cap on the tax exclusion for employer-provided health coverage, which has long been open-ended and so has encouraged high-premium insurance coverage. The House proposal bears a clear resemblance to this approach. It involves some deregulation from Obamacare, it includes a refundable tax credit for coverage, it gestures toward incentives for continuous coverage. But it is also fundamentally different from this approach, because it functions within the core insurance rules established by Obamacare, which means it can’t really achieve most of the key aims of the conservative reforms it is modeled on.  Perhaps the clearest example of this problem is one of the more peculiar features of the new proposal: the 30 percent surcharge on premiums for people who have not been continuously insured. This is an echo of the protection for continuously covered people that has been part of many Republican health-care proposals in recent years. But it is distorted by the fact that Obamacare’s rules would remain in effect.  Its goal, presumably, is to discourage people from waiting to buy coverage until they are sick by making insurance more expensive to people who haven’t been insured for a while. But in practice, this kind of penalty would probably have the opposite effect. It would create a disincentive for everyone who hasn’t been continuously covered to get coverage, by making insurance more expensive for them. But that disincentive would do more to drive away healthy people than sick people, since the added premium is more likely to be worth it to someone who otherwise would have higher costs than to someone just looking to get insurance for a rainy day. It would, in other words, exacerbate the problem it is trying to mitigate. And why have such a peculiarly designed continuous-coverage feature? Because Obamacare’s rules would remain in effect.  The way continuous coverage protection has usually been thought of in prior conservative proposals assumed you’d get rid of Obamacare’s form of community rating and then re-introduce a version of community rating available only to people who have been continuously insured (in a system where everyone could afford to be continuously insured with at least catastrophic coverage). So as a benefit of being continuously covered you get guaranteed renewability of your existing plan regardless of changes in your health and also some constraint on risk rating when switching plans. That would make insurance much more attractive to healthier people, since they could get in at a lower rate and then either keep their plan at that rate or have some protection from the full effects of pre-existing conditions on their premium when switching to another plan. It would be a strong reason to get covered when you’re healthy, rather than a reason not to.  The architects of the House proposal seem to think they can’t do this because they can’t alter Obamacare’s community rating in reconciliation. So they opt for a new surcharge instead of a rule change. But (as suggested above) it’s not clear why they should be able to get this new surcharge through reconciliation but not be able to get rid of or alter the terms of community rating through reconciliation. As a chapter heading called “continuous coverage protection” this could be excusable. As a specific policy provision, I don’t think it can.  Other structural elements of the proposal seem to be functions of a similar process of imaginary negotiation with an imaginary Senate parliamentarian. Not all, of course. The absence of a cap on the employer tax exclusion, for instance, seems to have its roots in more familiar political pressures. It, too, is a serious mistake that needs to be remedied.  But if they’re going to talk about remedying mistakes, then Republicans have to confront the basic inconsistency in this proposal about the Senate’s reconciliation rules, and the proposal’s resulting fundamental identity problem. They will need to decide whether what they’re moving is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare or a much more limited incremental measure defined by the bounds of the reconciliation process.  Both of those are viable and legitimate options, and which of them should be pursued depends on what Senate rules make possible at this point. But a combination of the two risks a dangerous incoherence—dangerous both to the political prospects of Republicans and (more important) to the practical prospects of the individual insurance market and the people who depend on it.  The two possible answers to that basic question would point toward two sets of remedies for problems with the bill. House Republicans could decide that it is not their job to solve procedural problems in the Senate and proceed with a bill that aggressively rolls back the insurance regulations in Title I of Obamacare and then enacts a different approach—returning insurance regulation to the states and subsidizing catastrophic coverage. That would leave it to the Senate to decide how much of such a bill to retain and in what form, whether on the floor in response to Democratic challenges under the Byrd Rule or in preparing a wraparound amendment in advance. Senators would presumably want to alter the credit in such a bill to make it more generous at the bottom, perhaps to require insurers to offer default plans with premiums equal to the credit, and also to reinstate the cap on the employer exclusion. (James Capretta has outlined what some of these changes might look like.)  Elements of such a bill that could not be included in reconciliation might then be attempted separately on regular-order legislation (like the reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program coming later in the year) that Democrats will feel pressure to vote for. And whatever gets enacted could be supplemented by regulatory action from HHS. Some of this might succeed, some of it would not. But Republicans will have tried to repeal and replace Obamacare and can proceed based on the outcome. Or House Republicans could decide that there is no reason to expect Senate rules to allow them to take on Obamacare’s insurance regulations and instead pursue something more like a set of stabilizing transitional reforms through reconciliation. These could be things like what the House bill envisions as a transition to a new system, which breaks the bounds of the exchanges and loosens rules some—again, in conjunction with vital regulatory reforms from HHS. It could also involve the replacement of Obamacare’s subsidies with the kind of credit the House bill envisions (albeit more generous at the bottom and funded by a cap on the employer exclusion). But it would not pretend to be a repeal of Obamacare, but rather an effort to loosen its strictures to the extent possible, with more to come if and when it’s achievable. Avik Roy has proposed changes to the bill that would essentially work this way. Given that such a bill would also include the House’s aggressive Medicaid reform, which surely can get past the parliamentarian, a bill that only goes this far would still be the most significant Republican policy achievement in a generation.  After either of these options is attempted, Republicans could look for paths to achieve more outside of the reconciliation process, by administrative action and perhaps through something like the Cassidy-Collins bill that would give states the option to retain Obamacare’s rules or adopt a more consumer-friendly, deregulated alternative framework (and which might get some Democratic votes). In other words, a bill pursued now could do more than the House bill now sets out to do, or it could do less. Presenting a partial step as a full one and pre-negotiating particular insurance-rule changes based on expectations about the Senate parliamentarian just doesn’t make for a coherent product.  Changes in one of these directions could now come through the work of the House committees or the Rules Committee. But they are more likely to happen, if at all, in the Senate. For that to happen, though, this process will need to get that far. And the substantive incoherence of this first version of the bill presents an obstacle to that happening. The score it receives from the CBO probably will too.  It is much too early to draft eulogies for this effort. Meaningful success remains entirely plausible. But the intense emphasis on speed and pure momentum is likely to undermine that prospect rather than advance it now. And in any case, momentum depends on a strong, successful push at the start. This could have started better, and it needs to end smarter.  "

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump has blocked several people who opposed him during the campaign from getting jobs in his administration. So why has he reportedly   chosen Jon Huntsman to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia ? -- The 56-year-old has earned a reputation as someone who ingratiates himself with his patron of the moment but whose long-term loyalty cannot be counted on. His critics — including some who have worked with him — complain privately that he’s always thinking about how he can climb the next step up the ladder. When his name comes up around this town, one often hears words like craven and opportunistic. While others from the Republican establishment were signing Never Trump letters last year, Huntsman was singing Trump’s praises. Elise Viebeck reported last October that “the theory in foreign policy circles” was that he “wanted to be secretary of state badly enough he was willing to risk his credibility on Trump.” But Huntsman seemed to calculate after David Fahrenthold uncovered the 2005 “Access Hollywood” video of Trump boasting about groping women that he could no longer win. So, just weeks before the election, he called on Trump to drop out of the race. “In a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom — at such a critical moment for our nation — and with so many who have tried to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for Governor Pence to lead the ticket,” Huntsman told The Salt Lake Tribune , which is owned by his brother. After Trump won, though, Huntsman changed his tune again. As the foreign policy firmament fretted about Trump’s phone conversation with the leader of Taiwan, Huntsman surprised many of his old friends by rushing to the president-elect’s defense on Fox News and in the New York Times. He described the move as “shrewd.” It could be a “useful leverage point,” he said. “Having lived in Taiwan twice and having lived in China once, there's a little too much hyperventilating about this one,” Huntsman said on Fox. -- It’s unclear what strings he might have pulled behind the scenes, but Huntsman was soon floated by transition officials as a potential dark-horse pick for secretary of state. When he got passed over for Rex Tillerson, he stayed in the mix to become deputy secretary of state. Now he’s settled for another foreign posting. -- The whole Huntsman family has been part of the charm offensive: Mary Anne, one of the ambassador's daughters, played piano at the White House yesterday: Abby Huntsman, a co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" conducted a softball interview with Sean Spicer last week: -- Assuming he’s confirmed by the Senate, Hunstman will become a very high-profile figure. Anything Trump does vis-à-vis Russia will be under a microscope by Congress and the media. Michael Flynn’s resignation and Jeff Sessions’s misleading sworn testimony — both related to conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States — underscore the sensitivity of the job he’s taking on. If Trump continues to pursue rapprochement with the Kremlin, suspicions will run very high about his motives, and Huntsman will be called upon to defend the policy as beneficial to the national interest. -- Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said overnight that he hopes Huntsman will help Trump improve relations. “We will welcome any head of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow who will be a staunch supporter of the idea to establish dialogue between the two countries. We believe that this is the main task of any ambassador in any country,"" Peskov told the state-sponsored Sputnik news organization. -- Another person breathing a sigh of relief is Orrin Hatch. There’s been rampant speculation in Utah that Huntsman might challenge the 82-year-old senator for the GOP nomination next year. He won’t be able to do that from Moscow. George H.W. Bush swims in the Pacific during a 1990 vacation to Honolulu. (Joe Marquette/UPI) HOW HUNTSMAN MADE IT THIS FAR: -- George H.W. Bush named him ambassador to Singapore when he was just 32, making him the youngest U.S. ambassador in a century. He had helped Bush with fundraising in Utah, and his billionaire father — who previously worked in the Nixon administration — was (and remains) a major GOP donor. When George W. Bush became president, Huntsman left his family’s business to become deputy U.S. trade representative. Then he returned to Utah to run for governor in 2004. With a growing national profile, he cruised to reelection in 2008. -- Barack Obama’s White House was worried that he could pose a very strong challenge in 2012. To sideline him, the president appointed Huntsman as ambassador to China. The gambit failed. Huntsman came back to run anyway. But Huntsman was hobbled by his links to Obama in that campaign, specifically a handwritten love letter he’d sent the then-president in 2009. Praising him as gracious and kind, he wrote: “You are a remarkable leader — and it has been a great honor getting to know you.” He underlined the word remarkable for emphasis. In another letter , Huntsman effusively praised Hillary Clinton. “I have enormous regard for your experience, sense of history and brilliant analysis of world events,” he wrote Bill Clinton. “I must report that Sec. Clinton has won the hearts and minds of the State Dept. bureaucracy — no easy task. And after watching her in action, I can see why. She is well-read, hard working, personable and has even more charisma than her husband! It’s an honor to work with her.” -- The portrait of Huntsman in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s book about the 2012 election was particularly unflattering . Both the candidate and his wife are depicted as especially shallow. Then-White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley called Huntsman in the middle of the night in Beijing after reading a Washington Post story about his campaign-in-waiting while he was still serving as Obama’s ambassador. “This is a pretty s---y way to treat someone who gave you the opportunity of a lifetime,” Daley told him. Huntsman denied The Post’s report, even though he knew it was accurate. Donald Trump made a show of humiliating Mitt Romney by pretending to consider him for secretary of state. He invited journalists to photograph them eating at Jean Georges restaurant in November. Romney had refused to endorse Trump during the campaign. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) -- Mitt Romney also came to detest Huntsman, a fellow Mormon, after he defected to John McCain ahead of the 2008 primaries. “Your grandfather would be ashamed of you,” Romney told him at the time, according to an account in the Halperin and Heilemann book . Mitt got sweet revenge four years later by crushing Huntsman like a bug in New Hampshire. Especially meaningful to him was McCain’s endorsement three days before the Granite State’s first-in-the-nation primary. Hunstsman saw this as a betrayal and personally emailed the Arizona senator to complain, noting the price he’d paid in Utah for snubbing a favorite son four years before. -- Ironically, Huntsman attacked Romney during the 2012 campaign for sucking up to Trump. The former Massachusetts governor schlepped to Trump Tower to seek the businessman’s support in September 2011 , following a procession of other candidates that year that included Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich. Huntsman bragged that he didn’t meet with Trump during one of the debates. Trump, who had flirted with running that year before taking a pass, wanted to play the role of kingmaker. He announced that he would sponsor a debate in Des Moines the week before the Iowa caucuses. Huntsman immediately declared that he would not participate. ""We look forward to watching Mitt and Newt suck up to The Donald with a big bowl of popcorn,"" said Huntsman spokesman Tim Miller. -- Huntsman claimed that Trump asked him for a meeting, and he declined. Trump responded that Huntsman was the one who tried to meet with him, but that he had not returned Huntsman's calls. The then-reality TV star took several digs at his Mormon faith during the ensuing spat , which became an issue in Utah last fall. Trump relished and even took credit for Huntsman’s inability to gain traction and, over a period of several months, mocked him on Twitter as an ineffective ambassador to Beijing: Asked back then about Trump’s attacks, Huntsman replied on Fox News: ""I'm not going to kiss his ring, and I'm not going to kiss any other part of his anatomy.""

(Delil Souleiman/Getty)  ESCALATION -- MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA: -- The U.S. military is getting drawn deeper into the struggle for control over areas liberated from the Islamic State —  risking prolonged American involvement in wars in Syria and Iraq long after the militants are defeated.  Liz Sly reports : “In their first diversion from the task of fighting the Islamic State since the U.S. military’s involvement began in 2014, U.S. troops dispatched to Syria have headed in recent days to the northern town of Manbij … to protect their Kurdish and Arab allies against a threatened assault by other U.S. allies in a Turkish-backed force. Russian troops have also shown up in Manbij under a separate deal that was negotiated without the input of the United States. … Under the deal, Syrian troops are to be deployed in the area, also in some form of peacekeeping role, setting up what is effectively a scramble by the armies of four nations to carve up a collection of mostly empty villages in a remote corner of Syria. The latest twist in Syria’s ever more complicated war points to one of the many risks of a U.S. strategy that has prioritized the military defeat of the Islamic State at the expense of political solutions to the broader conflicts fueling instability in the wider region, analysts say."" -- Marines from an amphibious task force have left their ships in the Middle East and deployed inside Syria, where they will use artillery guns in the fight to help Syrian rebels wrest control of Raqqa from the Islamic State. The new mission comes as the Trump administration weighs a plan to take back Raqqa, the de facto ISIS capital, that includes more Special Operations troops and attack helicopters. Dan Lamothe and Thomas Gibbons-Neff report : “The deployment puts more conventional U.S. troops in the battle. ... Several hundred Special Operations troops have advised local forces there for months, but the Pentagon has mostly shied away from using conventional forces in Syria. ” One official says the Marines movement into Syria is not the byproduct of Trump’s request of a new plan to take on ISIS and that it has “been in the works for some time.” -- Soft power: Rex Tillerson has invited more than 60 countries to send representatives to Washington later this month for a two-day strategy session on how to best fight the Islamic State.

A lobbyist for defense contractors. An ‘evangelist’and lobbyist for Palantir, the Silicon Valley company with close ties to intelligence agencies. And a New Hampshire Trump supporter who has only recently graduated from high school. These are some of the people the Trump administration has hired for positions across the federal government.

Politico’s Kenneth P. Vogel and David Stern report : “The operative, Konstantin Kilimnik, came under scrutiny from officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department partly because of at least two trips he took to the U.S. during the presidential campaign … Kilimnik, a joint Russian-Ukrainian citizen who trained in the Russian army as a linguist, told operatives in Kiev and Washington that he met with Manafort during an April trip to the United States. And, after a late summer trip to the U.S., Kilimnik suggested that he had played a role in gutting a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform that would have staked out a more adversarial stance towards Russia …  The FBI declined to comment on Kilimnik, while the State Department did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear if either agency launched any kind of official inquiry into Kilimnik, nor is it clear whether the interest from the U.S. authorities is ongoing.” -- Former national security adviser Michael Flynn earned $530,000 for consulting work last fall that may have helped benefit Turkey.

Despite those challenges, the White House’s infrastructure team has become one of its broadest task forces, with Trump considering it a central plank of his promise to create more jobs. He has activated a team of White House and Cabinet agency officials to identify a wide range of infrastructure projects across the United States and come up with a way to fund them, launching the internal deliberations to design the $1 trillion package he promised on the campaign trail. On Wednesday, Trump hosted an infrastructure-focused luncheon with SpaceX founder Elon Musk, General Atlantic chief executive William Ford and a number of others.”  The quick shift from popular campaign promise to the bogged-down bureaucratic negotiation process is the latest test of Trump’s ability to pivot from thematic ideas to concrete action. And on infrastructure in particular, he faces challenges selling fellow GOP lawmakers on his plans once they do jell.  -- Trading butter for guns: The Trump administration is considering more than $6 billion in cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development – potentially moving to squeeze public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants, which provide services such as meal assistance and cleanup of abandoned properties in low-income neighborhoods. This is the latest proofpoint that Trump is serious about slashing domestic spending by $54 billion to fund a defense build-up. “Budgets for public housing authorities — city and state agencies that provide subsidized housing and vouchers to local residents — would be among the hardest hit,"" Jose DelReal reports.  ""Under the preliminary budget, those operational funds would be reduced by $600 million, or 13 percent. … The proposal would also reshape the federal government’s involvement in local community development, potentially eliminating a decades-old program that funnels federal dollars into programs that combat poverty and urban decline, and fund other local improvement efforts.” -- The Senate voted 59-40 to overturn Obama-era regulations on teacher preparation, rolling back efforts that require each state to issue annual ratings for teacher-prep programs within their borders. The House has already voted to repeal the regulations, and the White House supports the effort. ( Emma Brown ) -- Two Democratic congressmen who met with Trump this week said he told them privately that he would agree to support their bill to allow the government to negotiate on behalf of Medicare when buying prescription drugs. Carolyn Y. Johnson reports : Reps. Elijah E. Cummings and Peter Welch said they had procured Trump’s support for their measure after nearly an hour-long meeting on Wednesday. “I’m going to join with you' — those are his exact words — to make this happen,"" Cummings said in a post-meeting conference call. ""He felt that it was important that we address this issue head on. As a matter of fact, I would again describe his position as being enthusiastic."" In a statement, the White House said Trump wanted to work together in a bipartisan fashion to make prescription drugs more affordable, but the statement did not specifically say that the president would support the bill they left for him to review. -- Jeff Sessions has formally directed federal prosecutors to “use every tool we have” to target most violent offenders in the country, urging prosecutors to “aggressively” laws regarding firearms, robbery, carjacking and drug offenses as tools to bring investigations and prosecutions against suspected criminals. “Sessions’s memo to his prosecutors follows a speech he gave last month to state attorneys general in which he said that historically low crime rates might be coming to an end and that recent crime increases could foreshadow a violent new period in the nation’s history,” Sari Horwitz reports .  Lindsey Graham may have had lunch with Trump, but he is not messing around. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) WIRETAPPING FALLOUT: -- Two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the FBI and Justice Department to hand over any potential warrant applications related to possible wiretaps of the Trump team, following up on the president's unsubstantiated allegations against his predecessor. Karoun Demirjian reports : The letter, penned by Sens. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse, asks the agencies for “copies of any warrant applications and court orders — redacted as necessary ... related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower.” “We would take any abuse of wiretapping authorities for political purposes very seriously,” they wrote. “We would be equally alarmed to learn that a court found enough evidence of criminal activity or contact with a foreign power to legally authorize a wiretap of President Trump.” -- Ex-Trump aides say the New York businessman has long been worried about people “listening in” on his calls and expressed “regular” concern that his Trump Organization phone lines were not secure. The AP reports : “At times he talked about possible listening devices and worried that he was being monitored, two executives said. In other times, he was doing the monitoring. One of the executives said Trump occasionally taped his own phone conversations using an old-school tape recorder , although Trump once denied this. ‘I assume when I pick up my telephone, people are listening to my conversations anyway, if you want to know the truth,’ Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt [in 2015]. ‘It’s pretty sad commentary, but I err on the side of security.’” -- Trump's White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Obama's former White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, have spoken since Trump claimed Obama had him wiretapped , per CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Kevin Liptak . “There have also been conversations between other former Obama officials and Trump officials since Saturday.” -- “ WikiLeaks disclosure exposes rapid growth of CIA digital operations — and agency vulnerabilities ,” by Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Julie Tate: “On his workplace bio, he describes himself as a ‘malt beverage enthusiast,’ [and] a fitness buff fond of carrying a backpack full of bricks … He is also a cyberwarrior for the CIA, an experienced hacker whose résumé lists assignments at clandestine branches devoted to finding vulnerabilities in smartphones and penetrating the computer defenses of the Russian government. The trove of documents exposed by WikiLeaks provides an unprecedented view of the scale and structure of this operation, which encompasses at least 36 distinct branches devoted to cracking the espionage potential of cellphones, communication apps and computer networks supposedly sealed off from the Internet. But in their descriptions of elaborate exploits and sketches of specific employees, the documents also point to the CIA’s vulnerabilities. As much as it is organized to exploit the pervasive presence of digital technology abroad, the CIA’s own secrets are increasingly created, acquired or stored on computer files that can be copied in an instant.” Ivanka Trump talks with other guests at a luncheon in honor of International Women's Day. (Shawn Thew/EPA) THE FIRST FAMILY: -- Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are renting their Washington home from a Chilean billionaire who is currently suing the United States government over a Minnesota mine. The Wall Street Journal reports: “The six-bedroom house in the capital’s Kalorama neighborhood was bought for $5.5 million in late December by a company controlled by [business titan] Andrónico Luksic … The Obama administration in its waning days blocked a Luksic-company plan to build a giant copper-and-nickel mine adjacent to a Minnesota wilderness area, citing environmental concerns. The company and some Minnesota politicians are urging the Trump administration to reverse the decision. A White House spokeswoman said that the family was paying 'fair market value,' that the mining issue has never come up, and that the two were not aware of Luksic’s U.S. business interests at the time they agreed to rent the house.""  -- While China slowly comes to terms with a Trump-led White House, his daughter Ivanka has never been more popular. Simon Denyer reports from Beijing : “Chinese companies have been scrambling to add her name to their products since her father won the U.S. presidential election in November. There’s even a new Chinese cosmetic-surgery firm offering the chance to look a little more like her. An astounding 258 trademark applications were lodged under variations of Ivanka, Ivanka Trump and similar-sounding Chinese characters between Nov. 10 and the end of last year … The trademark applications cover a dizzying array of products, including diet pills, anti-wrinkle cream, spa services, massage machines, cosmetic surgery, underwear and sanitary napkins. Ivanka, of course, has her own line of fashion items and has registered nine trademarks in China, with 26 applications pending and three rejected. But many other companies want to take advantage of her fame.” -- Public opinion of Melania has spiked since her husband took office, according to a new CNN/ORC poll : Favorability ratings for the new first lady have risen 16 points during her time in the White House, and a full 52 percent majority now report having a favorable opinion of her. (Pre-inauguration, just 36 percent of Americans said they approved.) DIVIDED AMERICA:   -- FiveThirtyEight, “ Purple America Has All But Disappeared ,” by David Wasserman: “If you feel like you hardly know anyone who disagrees with you about Trump, you’re not alone: Chances are the election was a landslide in your backyard. More than 61 percent of voters cast ballots in counties that gave either Clinton or Trump at least 60 percent of the major-party vote last November. That’s up from 50 percent of voters who lived in such counties in 2012 and 39 percent in 1992 — an accelerating trend that confirms that America’s political fabric, geographically, is tearing apart.” Consider these three remarkable data points from the story: Of the nation’s 3,113 counties (or county equivalents), just 303 were decided by single-digit margins — less than 10 percent. In contrast, 1,096 counties fit that description in 1992, even though that election featured a wider national spread. During the same period, the number of extreme landslide counties — those decided by margins exceeding 50 percentage points — exploded from 93 to 1,196, or over a third of the nation’s counties. Between 1992 and 2016, the share of voters living in extreme landslide counties quintupled from 4 percent to 21 percent. “In an increasing number of communities like Baldwin County, Alabama, which gave Trump 80 percent of its major-party votes, and San Mateo, California, which gave Clinton 80 percent, an entire generation of youth will grow up without much exposure to alternative political points of view. If you think our political climate is toxic now, think for a moment about how nasty politics could be 20 or 30 years from now. ” -- “ Gov. Joe Piscopo? Candidates in two states try to use lessons learned from Trump ,” by John Wagner: “The appeal of [Trump]-style populism could soon be tested by another celebrity candidate with no governing experience: Joe Piscopo. The former [‘SNL’] cast member best known for his impersonation of Frank Sinatra is ‘very close’ to jumping into the New Jersey governor’s race , inspired in part by his interactions with ‘real Americans’ while on the campaign trail with Trump. Piscopo’s possible bid reflects the maneuvering in New Jersey and Virginia — the two states with gubernatorial contests this year — by candidates from both parties, who are trying to capitalize on lessons learned from Trump’s strong performance among working-class voters. And some are mimicking him in other ways. [One hopeful] … told a story with some Trumpian bluster that involved a member of the clergy who described New Jersey as ‘a humble valley in the shadow of New York and Philadelphia.’ ... 'When the event was over, I went up to the clergy and kicked him right in the shins,' he said. “We are a cultural, economic and intellectual powerhouse … we are not going to be [second-rate] … to anybody.'""

The group has had little discernible movement since its launch in January and has only now, Pierson says, settled on a location for its headquarters (she can’t remember exactly where it is). She admits the group hasn’t ‘done anything exciting yet,’ but, with a flourish that would make her former boss glow, she says it has ‘some opportunities to do some really great things in the future.’ It’s all terrifically vague and unglamorous for someone who once championed her role as team Trump’s most visible player.

8.398996315637842e+17	Thu Mar 09 18:04:11 +0000 2017	"President Trump addresses the crowd during a Conservative Political Action Conference event. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) It was a cross between Poynter.org and “The Five.” Today at a journalism conference titled “Covering Trump” and organized by the Columbia Journalism Review, a Breitbart editor faced off against representatives of four news organizations that — well, let’s just say that their one-time leader is not now a top adviser to President Trump. John Carney, financial editor for Breitbart, asked his fellow panelists, “Do you think you have enough people who understand and sympathize with Trump’s worldview in your news organizations or do you think you are predominantly staffed by people who view Trump’s point of view as not just wrong but probably also evil?” To which, New York Times Washington Bureau Chief Elisabeth Bumiller responded, “Do you have enough people in your organization who disagree with Trump’s point of view?” Carney responded by citing the following story, which spoke of the imminent nomination of Andrew Puzder to serve as Trump’s labor secretary: “ Trump Expected to Tap Labor Secretary Who Prefers Foreign Labor to American Workers .” The back-and-forth — moderated by CJR’s Kyle Pope — was triggered by Bumiller’s account of how the New York Times’s Washington bureau has responded to the ascent of Trump. “In these tough times, we’re adding reporters,” said Bumiller. “I think what’s happened in the Washington bureau is this enormous sense of mission and people are energized. They are working like they’ve never worked before because suddenly everything is clear and our mission is to hold the administration accountable — cover the administration fairly and thoroughly but also hold it accountable.” In no way was Carney going to allow those comments to go uncontested: “I have a question about this,” he said. “Because I think it’s extraordinary that the press sort of woke up after Donald Trump’s election to a moment of clarity about its job. I think that’s one of the things that actually people find alienating. It looks like and I can’t help but wonder if this isn’t true, perhaps not of anybody on this stage or maybe everybody except me, that … fundamentally most journalists don’t agree with the worldview of Donald Trump. They can’t hear the phrase economic nationalism without thinking that this is bad. They come from a, I would say, a globalist-secularist point of view and the idea of a president who uses the phrase ‘America First’ strikes them as disturbing. They like to come up with the idea that Trump is the closest analogy is McCarthy. In other words, let’s pick a demon out of the past and paint the president with that color.” Panelist Jelani Cobb of the New Yorker interjected, “They had the same mentor.” Very entertaining and illuminating chatter: For a look at Carney’s imperative about having people who understand and sympathize with Trump, we needn’t think in terms of hypotheticals. CNN provides a fine test case. Once Trump started roaring in the primaries, CNN hired a number of contributors who both understand and highly sympathize with Trump’s ideology, such as it is. Jeffrey Lord, Kayleigh McEnany, Scottie Nell Hughes and several others were brought on to make sure that CNN’s airwaves properly represented the Republican front-runner. We know the results. These folks have poisoned CNN transcripts with all manner of illogic, nonsense and hypocrisy in defense of Trump. The embarrassments have spread out beyond CNN content, too: Hughes said in a radio interview after the election ,”There’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts.” She’s no longer with CNN. And McEnany “interviewed” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an event that she kicked off by leading a cheer  for DeVos. Those examples matter, because the suggestion that Carney offers is troublesome for news organizations. President Trump’s No. 1 platform item — the thing on which he has been most consistent, most insistent — is contempt for the media. We needn’t here detail all the various things he has done to smear and delegitimize it. The implication is that media outlets seeking to hire Trump sympathizers must do business with people who favor — or at least make apologies for — reducing the credibility of news providers to the point that when they publish something damaging on Trump, no one believes them. How does that work? In assessing the plea for understanding and sympathizing with Trump, Cobb said that there’s a big distinction between those two things. People are criticizing Trump precisely because they do understand him and his motives. So let’s not pretend that filling the masthead with Trump-sympathizing voices is as facile as doing likewise for, say, the presidencies of Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. There’s a reason  CNN found that its existing stable of commentators couldn’t be relied upon to defend candidate Donald Trump. That said, there’s a great deal of merit to what the Columbia Journalism Review (with partners the Guardian and Reuters) did in this instance, which is to put opposing voices in small spaces. Carney blasted media outlets for proceeding with “selective credulity about false stories about Donald Trump” and cited, in part, the error of a Time magazine reporter about the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. allegedly being removed from the Oval Office in the initial moments of the Trump presidency. It wasn’t, in fact, removed; Time magazine corrected the mistake and apologized. Brian Stelter, the CNN host of “Reliable Sources,” opined that Carney was “cherry-picking” a journalist’s “stupid” mistake. Carney pushed back by saying that “this fit in with journalists’ view of who Donald Trump is and therefore they were willing to believe” it. Trump backers have a point here — that MLK bust thing was more than just a stupid mistake. "

New Customs and Border Protection reports indicate that illegal immigration at the Southwest border of the country is down 40% . Why? Is it  Donald Trump ‘s tough talk that is scaring away potential immigrants? Is there a bigger focus on prevention?  Kate Bolduan wanted to know the answers, so she assembled a panel on CNN today that included Fox News expat  Kirsten Powers ,  Angela Rye , Matt Lewis , and  Joseph Borelli . Powers, for one, was not pleased by the new immigration numbers. “If you believe that it’s a good thing that people — for example refugees who are fleeing Central America, very dangerous circumstances — no longer are coming to the United States as refugees, then I guess yes, it’s a good thing,” Powers said. “I don’t think that’s a good thing. I think what that says is people no longer are seeing the United States as a refuge for them.” She also pointed out that immigration experts can’t identify a definite cause of the decrease, but “inhumane things like General [ John ] Kelly talking about separating mothers from children” are worth consideration. “Does that work? Yes. Guess what? That does scare people. But the question is that what we want our policy to be, to scare people who are trying to flee violence?” she wondered. Rye backed Powers up on that. “The numbers are down, but at what cost?” she   asked, pointing out that there are real human beings suffering elsewhere who would now rather risk staying in violent situations than come to America, where they face the aggression of Trump. “At some point we have to value the conditions that humans are experiencing, not even within our borders.” Watch above.

Trump’s tweets are crazy, but what’s really important is whether the Trump team colluded with Russia in interfering with the United States election. I’ve been trying to report this out, and it’s the focus of my column today. Read! One of the points I make is that Democrats are, I think, overly focused on Jeff Sessions. He didn’t disclose his meetings with the Russian ambassador, but I just don’t see him as a secret conduit to the Kremlin. The person whom investigators have focused on more, quite rightly, is former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who had longstanding ties to Russia. Read the column for more . I was a young teenager when Watergate was unfolding (my family bought a television for the first time so we could watch the Senate Watergate hearings), and this feels similar in some ways. If you haven’t read the classic Watergate book, read it: “ All the President’s Men, ” by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, The Washington Post reporters who nailed the story. It’s a great read, and it foreshadows the present. Speaking of The Washington Post, what a great newspaper war we’re seeing between The Post and The New York Times. A couple of years ago, we wondered if new online outlets like Huffington Post and BuzzFeed were going to put legacy newspapers out to pasture, but reporters for The Times and The Post have done heroic work on behalf of the country. I actually feel a little badly for The Post that when Trump assails the press, he often rages about “the failing New York Times” and neglects to fulminate at the Post as much as it deserves. Lots has been written about the G.O.P. health care plan, but the bottom line is that millions will lose health insurance, the wealthy will get a big tax cut, Medicaid will be damaged over time, and women in some parts of the country will have more trouble accessing family planning, STD treatment and cancer screenings. In my Sunday column , I reported from women’s health clinics in Maine, and it strikes me as a scandal that one American woman still dies from cervical cancer every two hours — completely unnecessarily. And without funding for those clinics, I fear even more will die. One of our faults in journalism is that we’re too often behind the curve, partly because there isn’t much reader interest in issues that aren’t yet on the agenda. One danger that deserves more attention is the risk of a major pandemic, and the Trump administration is particularly poorly prepared for such a crisis, as  this Vox article  notes. One of the Obama administration’s successes was its handling of Ebola, despite criticism at the time from Republicans who wanted him to close the borders. And now here’s my column about 10 crucial dots illustrating ties between Trump and Russia, and how we should think of connecting them. Read!

After their second date, he walked Markin to her door, followed her inside and, she said, forced her to perform oral sex. Wurtzel later claimed the act was consensual, but in 2011 he pleaded no contest to sexual battery and was sentenced to a year in jail. His victim was disappointed in the short sentence, but she still believed a measure of justice would be served with her assailant locked behind bars at the Los Angeles County Jail. Instead, Wurtzel, who also had been convicted of sexual battery in a previous case, found a better option: For $100 a night, he was permitted by the court to avoid county jail entirely. He did his time in the small jail in the nearby city of Seal Beach, with amenities that included flat-screen TVs, a computer room and new beds. He served six months, at a cost of $18,250, according to jail records. Markin learned about Wurtzel’s upgraded jail stay only recently, from a reporter. “I feel like, ‘Why did I go through this?’” she said. In what is commonly called “pay-to-stay” or “private jail,” a constellation of small city jails — at least 26 of them in Los Angeles and Orange counties — open their doors to defendants who can afford the option. But what started out as an antidote to overcrowding has evolved into a two-tiered justice system that allows people convicted of serious crimes to buy their way into safer and more comfortable jail stays. An analysis by The Marshall Project and the Los Angeles Times of the more than 3,500 people who served time in Southern California’s pay-to-stay programs from 2011 through 2015 found more than 160 participants who had been convicted of serious crimes including assault, robbery, domestic violence, battery, sexual assault, sexual abuse of children and possession of child pornography. They include a hip-hop choreographer who had sex with an underage girl; a former Los Angeles police officer who stalked and threatened his ex-wife; and a college student who stabbed a man in the abdomen during a street scuffle. Like Wurtzel, those defendants were convicted of felonies, which can end in a state prison sentence. But judges have the discretion to order some felony offenders to serve time in county jails. In those cases, judges can also allow a defendant to serve the time in a city jail. Pay-to-stay jail assignments make up only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of inmates sent to detention centers in Southern California each year. But allowing some defendants to avoid the region’s notoriously dangerous county jails has long rankled some in law enforcement who believe it runs counter to the spirit of equal justice. The region’s pay-to-stay jails took in nearly $7 million from the programs from 2011 through 2015, according to revenue figures provided by the cities. In attracting paying customers, some cities openly tout their facilities as safer, cleaner and with more modern amenities. The Santa Ana jail’s website, for example, notes that jail is a “highly disruptive experience” and promotes its jail as a place where criminals can serve their time in a “less intimidating environment.” “The whole criminal justice system is becoming more and more about: How much money do you have? Can you afford better attorneys? Can you afford to pay for a nicer place to stay?” said John Eum, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department who investigated the hip-hop choreographer. Pay to stay is not cheap. From 2011 through 2015, the average cost of a stay — which can last from just one day to more than a year — was $1,756. The most expensive stay, according to jail records, was $72,050, paid by a man responsible for a drunken freeway crash that killed one of his passengers. Breaking down pay-to-stay convictions More than 3,500 people participated in pay-to-stay programs in Southern California from 2011 through 2015. An analysis found 4.5 percent of the cases involved serious offenses, labeled injurious or sex crimes in the table below. Source: individual city jails. A racial breakdown of pay-to-stay participants could not be determined because complete data were unavailable. Some defendants have done repeated stints in the pay-to-stay system, the analysis showed. Wurtzel, a one-time real estate developer, was one of them. In 2004, six years before the assault on Markin, he was accused of sexually assaulting women he lured to his upscale Pacific Palisades home through an ad for a live-in housekeeper. He pleaded no contest in 2007 to sexual battery of two women, one of whom was an undercover officer, and was sentenced to 135 weekends in jail. He split his time between Hawthorne’s pay-to-stay jail at $75 a night and Glendale’s jail, which then cost $85 a night. Wurtzel declined to comment. His defense attorney, Robert Schwartz, said that pay-to-stay jails were the appropriate place for his client, a convicted sex offender then in his 60s. “There’s a pecking order among inmates…he’s not somebody who would do well,” said Schwartz. “It’s still jail. There’s still the loss of freedom.” The judge in the case declined to comment. Most pay-to-stay jails have a sales pitch centered around security, but defendants also comparison-shop like consumers for amenities and flexibility. After he pleaded no contest to statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl who attended his South L.A. church in 2011, Leonel Pelayo, then 45, compiled a list of every pay-to-stay jail he could find. “County jail, you’re verbally abused, physically abused by everybody,” said Pelayo, who was a church leader. “I didn’t want to spend one day there.” He eventually settled on the jail in Seal Beach, paying $18,250 for the privilege, jail records show. “What I don’t agree with is people saying that’s not enough [punishment],” Pelayo said. “What’s the concept of punishment? Is it the time, or getting beat up every other day in jail?” B rutality and overcrowding have long plagued the Los Angeles and Orange County jail systems. They are the only adult jails in California currently under Justice Department scrutiny over concerns such as unsafe prisoner conditions, and similar allegations have been made by civil rights attorneys dating back to the 1970s. A legislative crackdown on drunk driving in the 1980s strained already overcrowded county jails, and a few small city jails with unused beds in Los Angeles County offered to take the spillover, as long as the inmate paid a daily rate for his or her costs. The applications poured in, many from inmates worried about the risk of assault in crowded county lock-ups. City jails in Orange County soon set up similar programs. Today, there are nearly 200 city jail beds for rent in Los Angeles and Orange counties, which have taken the most advantage of the option, by far. A Los Angeles Times-Marshall Project review of jails statewide showed only one pay-to-stay program outside Southern California — in Fremont, near San Francisco. The section of California penal code that allows people to serve county jail sentences in city jails specifies that the option is available for misdemeanor offenses committed in the same county where the pay-to-stay jail is located. But in practice, judges have allowed offenders convicted of felonies to participate in pay-to-stay — and allowed others to take advantage of the program even though they committed their crimes elsewhere. Nearly every pay-to-stay program welcomes people whose crimes have taken place across county or even state lines. In Southern California, city jails have housed more than 200 people who broke the law in Arizona, for instance, and have also accepted clients with arrests as far away as Iowa, Washington, Minnesota and Montana, a review of the data shows. Prices vary widely, with each city setting its own rate. Defendants can get a bargain-basement bed at La Verne for $25 a night or pay a modest $75 a night in Hawthorne. Or they can splurge, paying $198 a night in Redondo Beach or $251 a night in Hermosa Beach. Monterey Park even offers the option of serving time in half-day increments, for $51. “We just basically let them book their time,” said D.J. Casey, the lead records clerk for Monterey Park’s police department. “Sometimes they call and cancel and say, ‘My kid’s sick.’” On average, defendants served 18 days in pay-to-stay jails, the analysis found. Most facilities offer bunk beds and shared common areas. The programs vary in size from one cell, which contains two beds, a refrigerator, phone and television, in Fullerton, to an eight-bed dorm room in Montebello. Two programs, in Monrovia and Whittier, do not allow overnight stays; participants come in for shifts to do janitorial work and other duties. Most programs require paying inmates to perform chores in the jail. City jail administrators say they provide a valuable alternative for those who may be particularly vulnerable in county jail, such as sex offenders, celebrities and very young or old inmates. Jail administrators say they have to maintain a reputation for being sufficiently punitive or judges will refuse to send inmates their way. “We bend over backwards to make sure their basic needs are met. But they have to remember, it’s still a jail,” said Sgt. Steve Bowles, who runs Seal Beach’s pay-to-stay jail. “We’re just another option…it’s not the Four Seasons by any means.” frozen hot dogs and string beans being thawed in a bare-bones kitchen.

He got a taste of the more typical jail experience when he served his first 17 days in Orange County’s Theo Lacy Jail. He said his defense attorney was able to get the case transferred to a different judge and get him pay-to-stay jail for the remainder of his sentence. He handed over a $7,300 cashier’s check without hesitation. Here in Seal Beach, he was sharing his quarters with three 20-somethings.

In the marketplace of jail beds for rent in Southern California, Seal Beach has gained a reputation as the go-to jail for many deep-pocketed offenders. Seal Beach’s pay-to-stay program generates more revenue than any other city in L.A. and Orange counties, a review of records shows. In the fiscal year ending last June, Seal Beach took in $365,000 from paying inmates, making up close to half of the jail’s total budget of $766,662. The city received 24 percent more pay-to-stay revenue than Anaheim, the second-most lucrative facility in the Times-Marshall Project review. One reason the program is so lucrative for the small city is that it accepts more inmates charged with serious crimes — who tend to have longer sentences — than other cities. From 2011 to 2015, people convicted of crimes involving violence, threats of violence or sex-related crimes made up more than 16 percent of the Seal Beach jail’s 326 paying customers. That was a higher proportion than any other city with a significantly-sized program. It housed twice as many inmates convicted of assault, sex crimes, battery, domestic violence or robbery compared with Anaheim, which is more than 10 times its size. A spokesman for Anaheim said the city recently shut down its pay-to-stay program “based on restructuring and efficiency of operations.” Seal Beach, meanwhile, has actively marketed its jail.

Steve Bowles of the Seal Beach police department said he regularly meets with judges, and prosecutors and attends defense attorney luncheons to get the word out about his jail, and has taken out ads on bar association websites. The jail was also featured in a “Today” show segment on NBC. Seal Beach was the jail of choice for Los Angeles Kings defenseman Slava Voynov when he was sentenced to 90 days in 2015 for an incident of domestic violence that left his wife covered in blood and with a gash above her eye that required eight stitches. Bowles, who runs Seal Beach’s paying program, said it’s not the city’s role to decide who is allowed the pay-to-stay option. “We look at it as, it’s already been agreed to and vetted by the D.A., the judge and the defense attorney,” he said. “We’re here to fulfill our role in the criminal justice system.” Jack said he was thankful for the pay-to-stay option.

The coastal town best known for its quaint pier and naval base has gained a reputation that has made its jail popular among defense attorneys and their paying clients. Seal Beach’s pay-to-stay program generates more revenue from pay-to-stay than any other city in L.A. and Orange counties, a review of records shows. In the fiscal year ending last June, Seal Beach took in $365,000 from paying inmates, making up close to half of the jail’s total budget of $766,662 in the same time frame. The city, which charges $100 a night, took in 25% more pay-to-stay revenue than Anaheim, the second-most lucrative facility in the Marshall Project-Los Angeles Times review. The program’s revenue appears to be at least in part a result of the city’s decision to accept more inmates charged with serious crimes — who tend to have longer sentences — than other cities. From 2011 to 2015, people convicted of crimes involving violence or the threat of violence to another person and sex-related crimes made up more than 16% of Seal Beach jail’s 326 paying customers, a higher proportion than any other city with a significantly-sized program. It housed twice as many inmates convicted of assault, battery, or robbery compared with the runner-up, Anaheim, a city more than 10 times its size. A spokesman for Anaheim said the city recently shut down their pay-to- stay program “based on restructuring and efficiency of operations.” Seal Beach’s program, meanwhile, has thrived. After briefly shuttering its troubled, privately-run jail in 2007, Seal Beach reopened its detention center as a city-run operation and has since worked to promote its jails as an option for those facing time. A spokesman for Anaheim said the city recently shut down their pay-to- stay program “based on restructuring and efficiency of operations.” The jail was featured in a “Today” show segment on NBC, and as recently as 2013, the city took out an ad in L.A. Weekly advertising its flatscreen TVs, a computer and media room, and cleanliness — “Why spend your jail sentence of 365 days or less at county?” Sgt.

Seal Beach was the jail of choice for Los Angeles Kings defenseman Slava Voynov when he was sentenced to 90 days in 2015 for an incident of domestic violence that left his wife covered in blood and with a gash above her eye that required eight stitches. The city’s active marketing and willingness to take in those with more serious criminal charges with longer sentences, which carry heftier price tags at a nightly rate, has been financially rewarding: each inmate brought in an average of more than $5,000 to its coffers. Bowles, who runs Seal Beach’s paying program, said it’s not the city’s role to decide who is allowed the pay to stay option. “We look at it as, it’s already been agreed to and vetted by the D.A., the judge and the defense attorney,” he said. “We’re here to fulfill our role in the criminal justice system.” One paying guest in the outdoor rec yard of Seal Beach jail last fall said he learned about the lockup through his well-connected attorney. He said he knew how fortunate he was to have the means to hand over a $7,300 cashier’s check, up front, without hesitation. Behind him, visible over the barbed wire fence were multi-million-dollar houses in a cul-de-sac abutting the police station. Inside, a couple of his jail mates were in the middle of a poker game on a steel picnic table, one animatedly giving another advice about a girl problem. In the bare-bones kitchen, frozen lunches of hot dogs and string beans were being heated up. Jack, 37, a one-time CEO of three financial services companies, asked to be identified only by his middle name because his young children thought he was in New York on an extended business trip. He said he got a taste of the more typical jail experience when he served his first 17 days in Theo Lacy Jail. “You’re in there like sheep, shoulder to shoulder,” he recalled. He said his defense attorney was able to suspend his jail stay, get the case transferred to a “preferential judge,” and get him pay-to-stay jail for the remainder of his 180-day sentence for driving under the influence of heroin. of which he was serving 90 days for “good time” credit. At Seal Beach, he said, there’s a large selection of DVDs and books, the hot water never runs out, and you’re treated like a human being. “I’m really happy I was able to come here,” he said. “But you need the money to do it.” The Times-Marshall Project review showed that much of the pay-to-stay program has stayed true to the original spirit: The majority of defendants who served time in the facilities from 2011 through 2015 — 79 percent — had driven under the influence or committed other driving-related offenses. But in dozens of other cases, the crimes were more serious. Nearly 3 percent of cases involved violence or the threat of violence to another person, including more than five dozen assault or battery cases, almost four dozen domestic violence cases, and a robbery. Among them were a pair of defendants who jointly attacked two sheriff’s deputies; two motorcycle gang members who assaulted a man in a bar fight; and a man who hurled his girlfriend against the couch in a jealous rage, breaking her jaw. The review of the data also showed that nearly five dozen people — about 1.5 percent of the total — were convicted of sex crimes, most of them involving abuse of minors, including child molestation, possession of child pornography and statutory rape. At least seven people served time in pay-to-stay programs after causing fatal vehicular accidents. Some prosecutions were marred by imperfect witnesses or murky circumstances. But it is not clear if judges considered that when allowing defendants to serve time in pay-to-stay jails. In October 2011, Eric Lund was walking with a friend in Huntington Beach when they clashed with Tanner Mester on the street. A war of words escalated into a brawl, and Lund stabbed Mester in the abdomen. They had lived distinctly different lives. Lund was a 21-year-old student at UCLA. Mester, who still had gang tattoos from repeated stints behind bars, was a former drug addict. At age 30, when he encountered Lund, he was clean, caring for a newborn and starting a plumbing business. Their experiences with the justice system turned out to be different, too. Lund, who argued self-defense, pleaded guilty to felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and faced up to eight years in state prison. As part of a deal, he was granted probation with a year in jail. The judge agreed that for $100 a night, Lund would serve his sentence in Seal Beach. The total price tag for Lund’s year-long sentence was $36,550, including a small administrative fee, according to jail records. Lund said he was hesitant to take his chances with a jury. “Once I knew I would get private jail versus Orange County jail, the year was a no brainer,” Lund wrote in an email sent through his current lawyer. Mester, who needed two surgeries to repair internal damage to his stomach and liver, had no idea it was possible in California to pay for special jail accommodations. “They tried to tell me he was afraid of the general population ... but that’s part of jail,” he said in a recent interview. “That’s what makes you not want to go back, it being such a horrible experience.” The prosecutor on the case, Lynda Fernandez, said she agreed to allow pay-to-stay after weighing the strength of the case against Lund. “I try to do justice the best way I can,” Fernandez said. It is ultimately a judge’s choice whether to permit a defendant to enter a pay-to-stay program. But judges were not eager to talk about their decision-making. More than a dozen judges in Los Angeles and Orange counties declined interview requests. Some city officials were also reluctant to disclose information, with five city jails declining to comply with public records requests until lawyers for The Marshall Project intervened. One, Baldwin Park, said it did not keep records prior to 2016. Pay to Stay participants by jail and offense INCLUDES ONLY CITIES WITH AT LEAST 50 PARTICIPANTS FROM 2011 TO 2015. IN SOME CASES, CONVICTION INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EACH PARTICIPANT. HUNTINGTON PARK WAS EXCLUDED BECAUSE CONVICTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR A MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS.

Shane Sparks, a choreographer with credits on the reality shows “So You Think You Can Dance” and “America's Best Dance Crew,” met Monique Fronti in the 1990s at the Los Angeles dance studio where he worked and she was a student. They began having sex a week before her 13th birthday, she later alleged. At the time, Fronti said, she felt forced into having sex and powerless to stop it. In 2009, she talked to a therapist, who reported the alleged abuse to police. Sparks admitted to a detective to having a sexual relationship with Fronti but said it was consensual. In a recent interview, Sparks said he assumed Fronti was of legal age because she sometimes worked behind the front desk. Sparks pleaded no contest in 2011 to sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 16 and served 135 days in Alhambra’s jail. Although a judge said Sparks had to serve his time within a year, he took two years to finish as he continued working and traveling internationally, according to court and jail records. “It was actually a retreat for me,” Sparks said of his time in jail. He wore his own clothes and brought his own bedding and food, he said. He said he spent most of the time editing musical recordings on his computer. “He got to take what he wanted from me and take what he wanted from the court,” Fronti said recently. “And at no point did I feel like I had justice.” Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Alison Foster said the difficulty of proving a 15-year-old case and Sparks’ clean record in the intervening years were all considerations in agreeing to the pay-to-stay sentence. She called it, “an unusual set of facts and not something that is considered in most felony cases.” T he state agency overseeing California’s jails is the Board of State and Community Corrections, which inspects the facilities every two years. But the board does not monitor whether or how much jails charge for their services, what kind of defendants they allow, or what amenities are available. City jail administrators say they carefully screen applicants and are willing to eject inmates who do not follow the rules. One of the most attractive conveniences in pay-to-stay programs — not available at county jail — is the option to go on work furlough, which allows people to go to their jobs with an ankle bracelet and return to the jail in the evenings to sleep. At least eight city jails offer work furlough, and most of the other pay-to-stay facilities allow people to serve time on weekends. The Los Angeles County jail has no weekend option, although Orange County does. For Robby Johnson, though, work furlough offered another opportunity. Johnson, a former Los Angeles Police Department officer, pleaded guilty in 2012 to stalking and harassing his ex-wife. He was sentenced to one year in jail and was allowed to serve in Seal Beach. Time served in pay-to-stay Includes only cities with at least 50 participants from 2011 to 2015. Data exclude those whose lengths of stay were unavailable. Source: individual city jails. For $120 a day, totaling more than $32,000 for 272 days, Johnson left the facility each weekday to work as a guard for American Corporate Security and teach fitness classes. But when recently contacted by reporters, those employers said they did not know Johnson was serving jail time and that they believed he forged letters from them to secure a judge’s permission to leave jail. In an interview, Johnson said his employers knew that he was in legal trouble, but when asked whether they were aware he was commuting to work from jail, he responded “probably not.” “If I would have told [my employers], I would have not been employed. And when you’re not employed, you go to prison.” Johnson no longer works for American Corporate Security. The company would not provide details about when or why he left. The L.A. and Orange County district attorney’s offices said they have no set policy or procedure for agreeing to pay-to-stay sentences. “Each case is decided on its own merits,” Los Angeles County district attorney spokeswoman Jane Robison wrote in an email. Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for the Orange County district attorney, said a pay-to-stay sentence for a serious crime is “not something we take lightly.” “We didn’t create the system,” Schroeder said. “So we have to work within it and figure out what is in the best interest of a case. You could even say that if it helps the taxpayer save money, that’s always a good thing.” See Inside The Beverly Hills Jail Tilt your phone to see a cell or the kitchen .

8.398891649507246e+17	Thu Mar 09 17:22:35 +0000 2017	"We are somehow submerged again in a pointless debate that I thought had been settled: Should media people ignore Donald Trump’s tweets? The answer, in my view, is obvious: He’s the president of the United States, everything he says is news, it doesn’t matter whether the form is a 140-character message, a YouTube video, a radio address or an answer to a shouted question while walking to Marine One. But the argument has taken on new resonance after Trump’s tweetstorm about Barack Obama having ordered him wiretapped during the campaign, a claim for which neither he nor his top aides have offered any evidence. CNN’s Anderson Cooper told Stephen Colbert that “I’ve actually muted the president on Twitter” because “I just don’t want to have that drama in my life.” But that was more of a joke, and Cooper made no claim that the tweets weren’t news. Rachel Maddow told The Wrap that on her MSNBC show, “We developed sort of an informal, internal mantra… which is that we basically cover them as if they are a silent movie. I stopped covering the Twitter feed.” The reason, she said, is that “the White House and its chief spokespeople have been called out saying stuff that’s not true over and over and over again.” Of course, Maddow and everyone else wound up covering “the Twitter feed” when Trump uncorked the wiretap allegation, because there was such an avalanche of reaction from members of Congress, the intelligence community, the media, and reporters and anchors questioning White House officials about the claim. Now comes Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com, with a National Review piece that makes a different argument from the right. The administration “seems divided along two channels: the rhetorical (the Sunday shows, Trump’s Twitter, Sean Spicer’s eminently watchable press conferences, profiles of Steve Bannon in Time) and the active (the executive orders, curbing of regulations, military action abroad).” Both provide a real picture of the White House, but “here’s a suggestion. Instead of treating Trump’s rhetoric seriously, wouldn’t America be better off if we did ignore it? What if instead of going nuts over a half-baked Trump tweet for a week, we all just recognized that the tweet is what it is: a half-baked Trump tweet? What if we returned to the notion of the president as a constitutional officer with prescribed duties?” Now it’s true, as Shapiro explains, that before FDR and the rise of modern communications, Americans didn’t know much about what their presidents were saying day to day. But we live in a real-time world now. My problem with the forget-the-tweets approach is that journalists shouldn’t be in the business of decreeing that a president’s words aren’t news. Whether the president is saying something half-baked, quarter-baked or fully baked, such postings provide an insight into his thinking and approach to the job. And they can have an immediate impact on markets, companies, political institutions and other countries. Even more important is the question of accountability. What if the press had decided to put off-limits some provocative, controversial or fact-challenged tweets by Barack Obama? Wouldn’t there have been an uproar on the right about how the media were protecting Obama, even censoring his words? Shapiro does make a telling observation: “Most Americans don’t care about Trump’s rhetoric any more. He and the media have been shouting at each other so long that it all sounds like white noise now.” Journalists often forget that everyone’s not on Twitter, everyone’s not watching cable all day, everyone’s not following all the nuances of political and policy debates. And yes, the press doesn’t need to go haywire if Trump fires off a tweet about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s demise as the “Apprentice” host. Ultimately, the president will be judged on his performance. But it’s not the job of the press to say that his words don’t matter. Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of ""MediaBuzz"" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Please understand that budget negotiations currently underway are very similar to those that have occurred in previous years.

It’s unfortunate that preliminary numbers were published but, please take some comfort in knowing that starting numbers are rarely final numbers. Rest assured, we are working hard to support those programs that help so many Americans, focus on our core mission, and ensure that every tax dollar is spent wisely and effectively. The Washington Post reported that preliminary budget documents show the massive cut, which would shrink the department’s budget by 14 percent. The cuts would hit public housing support and end most federally funded community development grants. Those programs provide meal assistance and clean up abandoned properties in neighborhoods.  Trump has said he wants to increase military spending by  $54 billion , which would be paid for by  slashing domestic programs . Carson won Senate approval to his new post with the  support of six Democrats . A retired neurosurgeon, Carson does not have experience in housing policy. He has said he believes  too many people are in public housing .  In his first speech to HUD employees earlier this week, Carson said slaves were involuntary immigrants who came to America and had to work “ for less .” He eventually apologized for his remarks.

8.398800158609285e+17	Thu Mar 09 16:46:14 +0000 2017	"The White House is downplaying reports that then-candidate Donald Trump met the Russian ambassador to the United States at a 2016 campaign event, just before Trump delivered a speech that called for “an easing of tensions” with Russia. The reports of Trump’s April 2016 encounter with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak comes just days after two of Trump's top advisers -- former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- became embroiled in controversy following the revelation that they each spoke with the ambassador prior to the Inauguration. Kislyak was seated in the front row as Trump delivered a 45-minute foreign policy address at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel, ABC News reported Sunday. The Center for the National Interest, which sponsored the event, released a statement Thursday saying that Kislyak was among about two-dozen people invited “a short reception prior to Mr. Trump’s speech” where the candidate greeted them in a receiving line. “The line moved quickly and any conversations with Mr. Trump in that setting were inherently brief and could not be private,” the statement said. “Our recollection is that the interaction between Mr. Trump and Ambassador Kislyak was limited to the polite exchange of pleasantries appropriate on such occasions.” White House officials dismissed the significance of Trump and Kislyak meeting in this manner. “If they met, it was in passing at arrival reception hosted by National Interest which [Trump] was present at for all of 5 minutes,” a senior White House official said Saturday. “We arrived minutes before the speech began and departed immediately after.” A White House official said that the Russian ambassador did not attend the speech at Trump’s invitation and that the Trump team was not responsible for inviting or vetting guests. ""We have no recollection of who he may have shaken hands with at the reception and we were not responsible for inviting or vetting guests,"" the official said. ""To state they met or that a meeting took place is disingenuous and absurd."" Trump has repeatedly derided suggestions of connections between his associates and suspected Russian officials as "" fake news "" and ""fabricated"" by disgruntled Democrats. ""I have nothing to do with Russia. No person that I deal with does,"" Trump said in February. Trump’s speech in the hotel ballroom offered an early look at the candidate’s approach to foreign policy. In addition to the Russian ambassador, then-Sen. Sessions was also in the audience. At the time, Sessions was serving as a senior campaign advisor. “I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia – from a position of strength – is possible,” Trump said in the speech. Contact between Kislyak and Trump campaign aides has been a repeated source of controversy. Flynn was forced to resign in February and Sessions had to recuse himself from any investigation into the presidential election after each had first denied contact with Russian officials, only to later acknowledge that they spoke with Kislyak prior to Trump taking office. At his confirmation hearing, Sessions testified that he ""did not have communications with the Russians"" amid intelligence reporting that the country had interfered in the election, the Justice Department confirmed last week that Sessions twice met with the ambassador during 2016 while was serving as a senator from Alabama and chairman of Trump's National Security Advisory Committee. Sessions' spokeswoman maintained that he was acting in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the attorney general said he was correct in his testimony to Congress during his confirmation hearing. Upon his forced resignation, Flynn admitted to speaking multiple times with Kislyak and ""inadvertently"" providing ""incomplete information"" to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the conversations. The White House additionally confirmed last week that Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner was present for a meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower in New York in December. "
8.398789340283003e+17	Thu Mar 09 16:41:56 +0000 2017	"Trump's first 100 days with ABC's RICK KLEIN and SHUSHANNAH WALSHE Day No. 49 The big story: Enter Donald Trump -- charmer, negotiator, dealmaker. He’s been away for a while, obscured in a haze of tweets and rhetorical missiles, wrapped up in a blustery tone that exhibited little interest in legislative blather. But these are his roots, and this will now mark his future as president. The humble start to the sales job on health care reform, with quiet, private meetings where participants are invited to air their concerns, is a break not just from what we’ve seen of Trump, but what we’ve seen from the most recent presidents. It’s a huge test for the current president, and it’s one for which he chose the terms. Will conservatives come along – after their public show of opposition, and urging from the AARP and the American Medical Association to sink the bill? It’s still a risky thing to bet on but a tough thing to bet against, assuming the new White House tone survives the news cycle. The sleeper story: As Capitol Hill waits on the Congressional Budget Office to “score” the new health care bill, the White House seems to be setting things up...to ignore it. “If you're looking to the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday, citing the CBO’s original Obamacare numbers, which were later adjusted. “When they come out with this score, we need to understand their track record when it comes to health care.” This is the latest signal from the White House that it intends to sideline the CBO, which has operated as the independent arbiter of costs and impact for generations – hard facts, in an era of spin. The “alternative facts” presidency has broader implications than health care or the budget: job numbers, growth statistics, climate data – all affect policy decisions where a common set of facts is valuable, if not critical. The shiny story: Now introducing President Trump’s pick to become the U.S. ambassador to Russia, the “disloyal” Jon Huntsman who “gave away our country to China!” Wednesday night came dinner with “Lyin’” Ted Cruz, a “very nasty guy” whom “you can’t make deals with,” not to mention what his wife looks like and what his dad may have done. That came after private meetings with “Lil’” Marco Rubio, plus Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham, both of whom have also been called “nasty,” and one of whom (Paul) reminded the president at one point of a “spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.” All of those descriptions are drawn from debates, interviews and tweets from Trump when he was a candidate – h/t to ABC News’ Chris Donovan for the compilation – and none have been formally disavowed. The game could go on, of course. But does any of it matter? Trump has proven that name-calling matters just about not at all, to either him or those he called awful names. He’s relying on those he insulted, and nobody seems to care. TLDR: The health care bill is a huge test for the president and it's time to bring out those deal-making and salesman skills we've heard so much about.

Notables --Former top spy chief: 'No evidence' Trump campaign aides recruited by Russia: Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told ABC News he did not see anything to suggest that Russia successfully infiltrated Donald Trump’s presidential campaign or recruited any of Trump’s advisers – at least as of Jan. 20, when the retired three-star general left office. ""There was no evidence whatsoever, at the time, of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians,"" Clapper, a career intelligence officer, told ABC News. The Clapper comments came amid a fight between the Trump administration and the FBI over the wiretapping claim the president made in a series of early morning tweets Saturday from his Palm Beach getaway, in which he accused former President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower.

READ MORE: A Miami man’s dark voyage into ‘crush’ porn He rushed out of the Miami courtroom, leaving spectators stunned. After jurors were ushered out, Gutierrez returned unharmed, with a singed pocket, and insisted it wasn’t a staged defense demonstration gone wrong, observers said.

8.398694035377644e+17	Thu Mar 09 16:04:04 +0000 2017	"Cork Wine Bar owners Khalid Pitts and Diane Gross  filed an unfair competition lawsuit against Donald Trump and the Trump International Hotel in DC Wednesday night, alleging that the president’s continued affiliation with the government-owned property puts competing businesses at a disadvantage. Scott Rome , one of Cork Wine Bar’s attorneys, says government officials, lobbyists, foreign dignitaries, and others seeking political influence—part of the restaurant’s clientele—now “feel pressure” or an “obligation” to frequent the hotel. “If they have a party to book, they’re going to book it there first, whether to gain influence with the president, to gain influence with the administration,” Rome says. “A nd he shows up there on weekends, so you get personal face time by going there.  It seems to us to be a clear situation in which he’s using his office of the president to get a financial gain at the expense of local businesses.” The Trump organization calls the lawsuit “a wild publicity stunt completely lacking in legal merit.” Cork Wine Bar, which hosts political fundraisers and international law firms, saw “significantly less income” after this inauguration than they’ve seen after other inaugurations, but Rome says the crux of the case isn’t going to be “look at our balance sheet” or pointing to a single specific incident in which a dinner was booked at Cork Wine Bar then switched to the Trump hotel. “It’s just that there’s more business that could be going to them and it’s not,” he says. “We feel like every place in town now is second place if you want to do business with the government in any way.” Pitts and Gross are no strangers to politics. Gross was a civil rights attorney who worked as counsel to former US Senator Barbara Mikulski ; Pitts has a rich history in the field, including a stint as a campaign director for Service Employees International Union and another as a political director at the Sierra Club. He ran for DC Council in 2014. As part of their case, Cork Wine Bar’s attorneys point to a clause in the hotel’s lease with the General Services Administration that says no elected official should have “any share” or “any benefit” from the agreement. Legal experts have argued that when Trump became president, the hotel was in breach of contract of the lease. “It’s our position that the Trump organization and Trump himself are using those conflicts of interests to get an unfair advantage against DC businesses,” Rome says. Plenty of stories have been written about the Trump hotel becoming a destination for those looking to gain favor with the president. In November, the  Post  covered a gathering over about 100 foreign dignitaries at the hotel. “Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’” one anonymous diplomat told the Post . Trump has previously said hotel profits from foreign governments will be donated to the US Treasury, but it’s unclear exactly how that’s working in practice. The hotel owns its restaurant, BLT Prime, which is why the steakhouse itself isn’t named as a defendant. BLT Prime’s parent company Esquared Hospitality has a management agreement to oversee its operations. Rome says that the lawsuit isn’t just an anti-Trump stunt. “From my position, if a Democratic politician was hurting clients in this way, I would have the same response,” he says. His co-counsel, Mark Zaid , known for representing whistleblowers, journalists, and others wronged by the government, has brought lawsuits against past administrations as well. Bolstering the legal team will be two George Washington University law professors: Alan Morrison , who specializes in public interest law, and Steven Schooner , an expert in government contracting. All the lawyers are working on the case pro bono, and the lawsuit isn’t seeking any money. Rather, they’re looking for a court order to stop the “unfair competition,” whether that means Trump divests or sells the hotel or takes his name off of it and transforms it into something else. Cork Wine Bar may not be the last DC restaurant to file such a lawsuit against the Trump hotel either. Rome says the lawyers are actively talking to other potential plaintiffs as well. A press conference about the lawsuit is scheduled this morning, so stay tuned for more information. The lawsuit comes amid two other ongoing legal battles between restaurants and the Trump hotel. Celebrity chefs Geoffrey Zakarian and José Andrés have been  locked in litigation since they pulled plans to open restaurants in the hotel in 2015 after Trump kicked off his presidential campaign with disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants. So far, there are no signs of settling. Pretrial conferences in both cases are scheduled for May. "
8.398683914606469e+17	Thu Mar 09 16:00:03 +0000 2017	"The National Interest and the Center for the National Interest have received many inquiries regarding President Donald Trump’s April 27, 2016 foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel. Accordingly, we have decided to release the following statement to share our recollections from that day. The National Interest magazine, which the Center publishes, organized the event to expose Washington’s foreign policy community and the American public to the views of a presidential candidate who was then the Republican front-runner. We were very pleased to have this opportunity and saw it as a public service. Because the Center for the National Interest is a non-partisan organization, our hosting the event did not and could not represent an endorsement of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Indeed, just a few weeks later, on May 23, 2016, we presented the Center’s annual Distinguished Service Award to Senator Tim Kaine and Senator Pat Roberts at a gala dinner. As is well known, Senator Kaine later became the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee. As the host, the Center for the National Interest decided whom to invite and then issued the invitations. The Trump campaign did not determine or approve the invitation list. Guests at the event included both Democrats and Republicans, with some among the latter supporting other candidates. Most of the guests were Washington-based foreign policy experts and journalists. The Center for the National Interest invited Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and several other ambassadors to the speech. We regularly invite ambassadors and other foreign representatives to our events to facilitate dialogue. Ambassador Kislyak was one of four foreign ambassadors who attended the speech that day. We seated all four in the front row during the speech in deference to their diplomatic status. The Trump campaign had nothing to do with the seating arrangement. The Center for the National Interest extended equal treatment to the four ambassadors attending the event and invited each to a short reception prior to Mr. Trump’s speech. The reception included approximately two dozen guests in a receiving line. The line moved quickly and any conversations with Mr. Trump in that setting were inherently brief and could not be private. Our recollection is that the interaction between Mr. Trump and Ambassador Kislyak was limited to the polite exchange of pleasantries appropriate on such occasions. We are not aware of any conversation between Ambassador Kislyak and Senator Jeff Sessions at the reception. However, in a small group setting like this one, we consider it unlikely that anyone could have engaged in a meaningful private conversation without drawing attention from others present. When Mr. Trump finished greeting guests in the receiving line, his Secret Service security detail promptly escorted him to a secure holding area behind the stage while speakers on stage introduced him to the Center’s guests and to the media. We did not see any opportunity for Mr. Trump to engage in private conversation with those attending the event during this time. After Mr. Trump finished speaking, he returned to the secure holding area with the Secret Service and his staff. The Secret Service did not allow anyone lacking necessary official credentials to enter that area. Accordingly, we are not aware of any way in which anyone else outside Mr. Trump’s traveling party could have entered this area. Mr. Trump and his party then returned directly to their motorcade with Secret Service escorts and departed from the hotel. "
8.398680920124498e+17	Thu Mar 09 15:58:51 +0000 2017	"U.S. and Ukrainian authorities have expressed interest in the activities of a Kiev-based operative with suspected ties to Russian intelligence who consulted regularly with Paul Manafort last year while Manafort was running Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The operative, Konstantin Kilimnik, came under scrutiny from officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department partly because of at least two trips he took to the U.S. during the presidential campaign, according to three international political operatives familiar with the agencies’ interest in Kilimnik. Story Continued Below Kilimnik, a joint Russian-Ukrainian citizen who trained in the Russian army as a linguist, told operatives in Kiev and Washington that he met with Manafort during an April trip to the United States. And, after a late summer trip to the U.S., Kilimnik suggested that he had played a role in gutting a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform that would have staked out a more adversarial stance towards Russia, according to a Kiev operative. The FBI declined to comment on Kilimnik, while the State Department did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear whether either agency launched any kind of official inquiry into Kilimnik, nor is it clear whether the interest from the U.S. authorities is ongoing. The Ukrainian prosecutor general in August did launch a formal investigation into Kilimnik’s suspected ties to Russian intelligence, according to documents obtained by POLITICO. The prosecutor’s office subsequently told POLITICO that it has cleared Kilimnik, though the Ukrainian parliamentarian who requested the investigation questioned its thoroughness and suggested the agency was trying to avoid an investigation that could have had implications in the U.S. presidential race. The revelations about the authorities' interest in Kilimnik come amid ongoing FBI and congressional investigations into Russia’s alleged meddling in the presidential race, as well as probes into ties between Russia and President Trump’s associates. Trump, who has downplayed U.S. intelligence findings that Russia, in an effort to help his campaign, engineered cyberhacks of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, has blasted the investigations as a witch hunt. And on Saturday, Trump accused former President Barack Obama, without evidence, of ordering the tapping of the phones at Trump’s New York campaign headquarters. Manafort summarily rejected questions about whether Kilimnik might be in league with Russian intelligence, declaring Kilimnik “pro-Ukraine,” and casting the inquiries into his associate as politically motivated “smears.” Kilimnik declined to answer questions about any interest by authorities into his activities. Instead, he attributed scrutiny of him to “a heated political environment [that has] led to exaggerated and out of context reporting in the hope of establishing connections that, to the best of my knowledge, have not yet been proven.” He added that “Ukraine and Ukrainians are being used as scapegoats in the U.S. political and media battles” — a dynamic that he said has been made “abundantly evident from how my own circumstantial relationships were misrepresented, exaggerated and overblown.” The White House declined to respond to questions about Manafort’s relationship with Kilimnik, or whether there were any inquiries into it by U.S. authorities. But two international political consultants who work in Kiev said that U.S. authorities became increasingly interested in Kilimnik after he made a trip to the U.S. in April 2016. Several people said Kilimnik told them that he met with Manafort during that trip, which came as Manafort was guiding Trump’s campaign through the bitter Republican presidential primaries , and trying to distance himself from his work in Ukraine. Kilimnik’s relationship with Manafort traces back to 2005. That’s when Manafort hired Kilimnik to work for him in Ukraine after Kilimnik was forced out of a position he held for about a decade in Moscow with the U.S.-based International Republican Institute amid suspicion over his ties to Russia. Manafort and Kilimnik were part of a group that formed a private equity fund that used millions of dollars contributed by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska to purchase a Ukrainian cable and internet company. And they did work on behalf of the businesses owned by Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Their work in Ukraine became political when Akhmetov began funding the political comeback of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. With Manafort’s help, Yanukovych was elected prime minister in 2006 and president in 2010 as the leader of the Russia-aligned Party of Regions. Multiple sources said the party paid millions of dollars a year to Manafort’s firm, for which Kilimnik eventually came to run the Kiev office. Manafort stressed that his work in Ukraine was intended to steer Yanukovych towards more pro-Western policies and more engagement with the European Union. And Kilimnik told POLITICO that “one thing that was grossly under-reported to date is the effort that Paul Manafort undertook to help Ukrainian leaders defend Ukraine’s interests and move the country towards [a European Union] Free Trade Agreement.” Yet Yanukovych in 2013 backed away from a commitment to that agreement, and fled Ukraine for Russia under the protection of Russian President Vladimir Putin amid widespread protests over government corruption. Manafort and Kilimnik started working for a Russia-aligned party that arose from the ashes of Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, operatives close to Kilimnik and Manafort told POLITICO. The new party, Opposition Bloc, stopped paying Manafort’s company, and the effort to collect unpaid invoices was part of the reason Manafort and Kilimnik remained in contact during the presidential race, the operatives said. But Kilimnik last month also told RadioFreeEurope that “every couple months” during the campaign he “was briefing [Manafort] on Ukraine,” though he subsequently clarified his comments, adding that he wasn’t formally advising Manafort. Manafort told POLITICO that he called Kilimnik to discuss what he called the “the smear campaign against me coming out of Ukraine” — a reference to the publication by Ukrainian investigators and the media of ledgers appearing to show $12.7 million in cash earmarked for him by the Party of Regions. (Manafort has said he never received the cash and has questioned the authenticity of the ledgers, as have some Ukrainian officials ). During their conversations last year, Manafort said he and Kilimnik also discussed an array of subjects related to the presidential campaign, including the hacking of the DNC’s emails , though Manafort stressed that at the time of the conversations, neither he nor other Trump campaign officials knew that Russia was involved in the hacking. When Kilimnik traveled to the U.S. in late summer, he drew the attention of U.S. authorities, according to a Washington consultant with ties to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. And when Kilimnik returned to Ukraine after that trip, he suggested to Kiev political operatives that he played a role in a move by Trump’s representatives to dilute a proposed amendment to the GOP platform calling for the U.S. to provide “lethal defensive weapons” for Ukraine to defend itself against Russian incursion. “He led me to believe that he was involved in the platform fight, but not necessarily through Paul,” said a Kiev-based operative who travels in the same circles as Kilimnik. The operative added that Kilimnik could have been “just bullshitting like political consultants do.” A Trump campaign adviser familiar with the platform debate said he was not aware of Kilimnik playing any role in the proceedings and, in fact, hadn’t even met Kilimnik. In Kiev, Kilimnik continued representing Opposition Bloc in meetings with international diplomats, according to several people in the international business and diplomat communities in Ukraine’s capital. Kilimnik is regarded there and in some U.S. foreign policy circles as a trustworthy liaison to the party and to an influential oligarch who is helping to fund it. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Several people who’ve worked with Kilimnik told POLITICO he was not particularly ideological and never betrayed either a strong bias toward or against the Kremlin as it grew increasingly hostile to Ukraine under Putin. But after a POLITICO exposé in August revealed Kilimnik’s suspected ties to Russian intelligence and other media followed the story, Volodymyr Ariev, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, formally requested that the country’s prosecutor general investigate Kilimnik. “This person, from his biographical details, could be connected to Russian special services, and could possess valuable information about the criminal activities of … former members of the Party of Regions and the government at the time of Yanukovych, who are being investigated by the general prosecutor,” Ariev wrote in a letter to the general prosecutor . The prosecutor’s office, which is obligated to investigate any inquiry from a member of parliament, for years has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation into government spending under Yanukovych. And, even before Ariev’s letter, it had questioned at least one person about the work of Kilimnik, Manafort and their associates on behalf of Yanukovych, according to a political operative in Kiev briefed on the inquiry. Ariev’s letter was dated Aug. 19 — a day after POLITICO’s exposé. Later that day, the general prosecutor’s office responded with a letter of its own , writing Ariev that his requested inquiry related to Kilimnik and Manafort’s company, Davis Manafort International LLC, “has been considered.” The letter indicated that the Kilimnik matter “has been combined” with the “criminal proceeding” into government spending under Yanukovych. But the press office for the prosecutor on Tuesday told POLITICO that “Kilimnik is not being processed now as a witness, suspect or accused.” Ariev told POLITICO “This is one of the shortest answers I've received from the general prosecutor's office. I think the reason is that the government did not want to be involved in the U.S. elections.” Nonetheless, the mounting scrutiny of Manafort’s work in Ukraine, and alleged cash payments from the Party of Regions, forced him to resign from the Trump campaign the same day that the prosecutor general’s office responded to Ariev.

8.398666467476152e+17	Thu Mar 09 15:53:07 +0000 2017	"The Medicaid aspects of Obamacare repeal are prompting concern from four Republican senators who are concerned about the prospect of reduced access to mental health and addiction services. | Getty House Republicans who last year made good on longstanding promises to overhaul the mental health system could roll back coverage for millions of people with mental illness and addiction problems by overhauling Medicaid as part of an Obamacare repeal package. Legislation being marked up Wednesday would phase out Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which covers 1.2 million Americans with serious mental illness and substance abuse problems, as well as scrap baseline coverage requirements. The change means certain beneficiaries would no longer get coverage for mental health and substance abuse treatments guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act. Story Continued Below ""We are really worried about its implications for people living with mental illness and addiction issues,"" said Chuck Ingoglia, senior vice president of public policy at the National Council for Behavioral Health. The Medicaid overhaul comes after Republicans in the previous Congress approved what Speaker Paul Ryan dubbed “the most significant reforms in a decade” to the mental health system. The bill authorized treatment and prevention programs and created a new assistant secretary for mental health at the Department of Health and Human Services. Some of those efforts could be undercut by more sweeping Medicaid revisions, according to some lawmakers and advocacy groups. The Medicaid aspects of Obamacare repeal are prompting concern from four Republican senators who are concerned about the prospect of reduced access to mental health and addiction services. Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska signaled they could withhold support for the House plan in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, declaring “reform should not come at the cost of disruption in access to healthcare for our country’s most vulnerable and sickest individuals.” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who co-authored last year's mental health overhaul package, called the House GOP bill a “dumpster fire that everyone should hate,"" and nearly all of the country’s largest mental health groups have lined up against the legislation in its current form. “We strongly encourage policymakers to recognize that all decisions about health reform must consider and provide for the needs of the most severely mentally ill,"" a spokesperson for the Treatment Advocacy Center said in a statement. ""Failure to do so will forfeit the momentum towards reforming our broken mental health system at tremendous human and financial cost."" The Obamacare repeal bill hasn’t been scored yet by the Congressional Budget Office, meaning it’s unclear exactly how many people could lose coverage. But mental health advocates say vulnerable populations could fare badly. The legislation would halt Obamacare's Medicaid expansion in 2020. Enrollees could stay on their plans, but anyone without continuous coverage for more than 30 days would lose eligibility. That worries advocates who say people with mental illness or addiction issues frequently drop off the rolls for periods of time. The bill also scraps the ACA requirement that certain Medicaid plans pay for the essential health benefits. ""This provision puts Medicaid enrollees at risk of losing mental health and addiction treatment coverage,"" Ingoglia said. Advocates are also worried about the way the bill would replace Medicaid's funding structure with capped payments to states based on the number of people enrolled in their Medicaid programs — a move likely to lead to federal spending cuts. “States will be required to make hard choices on which benefits they want to continue and on enrollment numbers,” said Stuart Gordon, policy director for the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. “We would hope that mental health and substance use disorder benefits and coverage ... will not be eliminated under that scenario, but the decisions will be made on a state-by-state basis based on state budgets, and that very well could lead to significant variations in benefits and coverage by states.” Chronic conditions like serious mental illness and substance use disorder are especially costly to treat. According to MACPAC, enrollees with a behavioral health diagnosis account for about $131 billion in spending, almost half of total Medicaid expenditures in 2011. “I have no idea whether the per capita caps for the elderly and disabled category are sufficient to accommodate the clinical needs of somebody with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,” a source in mental health policy said. “They are a high risk and expensive patient population with per capita spending exceeding $35,000 per year. I sincerely doubt that sufficient financing has been incorporated into the final version of the bill.” Under the GOP proposal, states would get $100 billion over a decade to stabilize insurance markets or fund high-risk pools, but experts worry that may not be enough and will eventually force states to pick up extra costs. “Those pools would be very important to people with serious mental illnesses ... and $10 billion a year may seem like a lot, but will offset only a fraction of the actual deficit,” Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of Mental Health America, noted in a blog post Wednesday. The House bill leaves in place protections for people with pre-existing conditions including mental illness, and it keeps in place the essential health benefits requirements for individual plans. Though it does not address mental health parity per se, Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) plans to offer an amendment during the Energy and Commerce Committee markup that would codify federal parity protections for people seeking mental health and substance abuse treatment.

8.39859868550955e+17	Thu Mar 09 15:26:11 +0000 2017	"In this week’s politics chat , we weigh the prospects of the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The transcript below has been lightly edited. micah ( Micah Cohen , politics editor): Welcome! harry ( Harry Enten , senior political writer): Hey, everyone! natesilver ( Nate Silver , editor in chief): Hello from United flight No. 538. harry : I remember United was also Continental. Remember that? natesilver : Dating myself, but I remember Piedmont Airlines, which was a big carrier in Lansing, Michigan, when I was a kid and served good honey-roasted peanuts. micah : For your consideration today: Will Republicans pass something resembling repeal/replace of the Affordable Care Act? Obviously, we don’t know the answer to that question, but we can dive into the factors pushing in either direction. Let’s start here, though: How’s the rollout of the House Republicans’ bill (the American Health Care Act ) going? natesilver : Phase 1. Fuck up the rollout. Phase 2. Pretend the fuck-up was part of a three-phase plan . Phase 3. ??? micah : Ehhh. How bad has the rollout really been? There’s been a lot of “dead on arrival” talk — isn’t that overkill? harry : Well, let’s see. Republican Rep. Jim Jordan says he’s going to file an alternative repeal plan. There are some Republican senators who are saying that the bill put forward by House Republicans doesn’t do enough to preserve the Medicaid expansion and others saying the opposite, that it’s too much like Obamacare. The AARP has come out against it . And we haven’t even gotten to the Democrats. That said, the bill isn’t doomed. clare.malone ( Clare Malone , senior political writer): Well, the latest I saw on Twitter was Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway trying to distance the White House from it, apparently. So I’m not sure what that says? micah : That seems like the real wild card, Clare. How much does the White House push this? perry ( Perry Bacon Jr. , senior writer): I keep reading that the rollout is going terribly . Can I just say that Paul Ryan got himself nominated vice president and then became House speaker. He is not clueless. He knew this bill would be bashed by lots of different groups. It is really hard to write a bill that pleases Heritage Action , Sen. Susan Collins , John Kasich and the House Freedom Caucus . harry : Trump, to be clear, hasn’t endorsed the bill. He says it’s up for review and negotiation . It’s the beginning of negotiations. And, yes, I agree, Perry. It actually reminds me of the GOP presidential primary. There was a majority against Trump, but it was a majority made of different factions that couldn’t come together. natesilver : But is it hard to write a bill that pleases at least one of Heritage, Susan Collins, John Kasich, Rand Paul, National Review, the AARP and the House Freedom Caucus? Absolutely nobody liked this thing. perry : I think that was the point. A bill that was too right is not going to pass. One that is too left is not going to pass. I’m not saying this will pass either, but I can see how they got here. micah : But don’t you think there’s a danger that if the politics of this get too messy (which seems inevitable) that Trump will just throw congressional Republicans under the bus? clare.malone : I’m not sure Trump would do that much, Micah. It seems unwise, in part because then they would say, “OK, well what you got, then?” They would presumably have to offer some kind of idea of what they actually liked. And they don’t seem to be particularly policy-focused. micah : Yeah, that seems like part of the problem here. What’s Trump’s endgame? What’s the Paul Ryan/Mitch McConnell endgame? Are those two things at all similar? natesilver : Relatedly: What’s the constituency for this bill? Who is it a “win” for? And even if the answer is “nobody,” someone has to take one for the team and be willing to sing its praises. harry : I don’t think it’s that crazy. Some people like oil, and some people like vinegar. To please both, you mix them together. The hope was that there would be just enough in this bill for each side that both would buy in. The risk is that there is just enough in the bill that both sides hate that they could end up hating the whole thing. clare.malone : Salad dressing, huh? micah : The Salad Dressing Theory Of Politics by Harry Enten perry : To go back to Nate’s question, I think the audience for the bill is 216 House members (a majority because of vacancies ). Is this something that they can vote for? I’ve seen lots of opposition to the bill from outside groups. But I am seeing the same five to seven Freedom Caucus members who oppose this quoted again and again. Are we sure 22 Republicans in the House will vote this down? I can concede the Senate is a different ballgame. harry : There was a theory posited by our friend Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics that Senate Republicans just want to be able to say: “We presented a bill to kill the ACA. Republicans voted for it. The Democrats didn’t. We need more votes. Vote Republican in 2018.” Not sure I buy that. But it’s a thought. micah : Blame red-state Democrats, basically. natesilver : Before we move on, just one more bit of pushback on your contrarian claim that the rollout wasn’t so bad, Micah. There was some basic blocking-and-tackling stuff that they failed at. Like, not communicating this three-phase plan thing, unless they really did make that part up as they went along. micah : What’s the three-phase plan again? natesilver : Phase No. 1 is supposed to be the current plan — which they say can be passed through reconciliation . Phase No. 2 is executive order stuff. And Phase No. 3 is stuff that needs to be passed with 60 votes in the Senate. perry : Specific parts of the rollout were bad. The hiding the bill last week. They have not explained well why they did not wait for a Congressional Budget Office score. They should have had some conservative validators lined up to sell the bill. micah : I was amazed watching “Morning Joe” on Tuesday — they said they couldn’t get anyone from the administration on to talk about the bill. So that does speak to a botched rollout. clare.malone : Well … who’s in charge of the rollout? Isn’t it really Ryan and company? Not necessarily the White House? harry : Yeah, it wasn’t the administration’s bill. natesilver : It’s like playing against the ’85 Bears and throwing a pick-6 on the opening possession because your receiver blew a route. Nobody said things were going to be easy, but you still have no excuse. clare.malone : I DON’T GET THAT. micah : So let’s dive into “whose bill is this?” clare.malone : Paul Ryan micah : Not Trump? clare.malone : Naw. perry : Ryan is the lead figure of this bill. Trump is involved now but can distance himself, since he can always say the Hill wrote the bill. So what Clare said. harry : What are the signs that Trump had anything to do with this bill? House Republicans had this bill under lock and key for weeks. Hence, the Rand Paul stunt . natesilver : I think it’s Ryan sort of trying to average out the desires of House Republicans and winding up with a solution that looks like it was crafted by committee. perry : Also, if not Trump, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Vice President Mike Pence will get blamed if this fails. They are closest to the House GOP. micah : IDK, Trump is the head of the party. To what Perry just said, the administration was reportedly working with House Republicans the whole time. It seems a bit rich for the White House to turn around now and say, “This isn’t us.” perry : Price was heavily involved in this bill. Pence did a rally with Ryan recently and said this was a huge administration priority. clare.malone : Well … welcome to Trumpism (to Micah’s point). harry : Yes, but as Perry wrote previously , there are so many players in Trump world. A bill could have the hand of Trump world in it, but that doesn’t mean Trump himself was part of it. clare.malone : Trump and Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, are in the business of pure practicality politics vs. ideology politics, right now, right? If things are looking bad, looking like they’re unpopular with your people, they give themselves the latitude to say, “Hey, we’re new to this, and we agree with you that these Washington insider guys got some things wrong.” micah : That’s my guess, yeah. perry : So before we conclude that Trump is walking away from this bill or might, are we sure that is true? He tweeted his support for it. He had meetings this week with the GOP whip team. I am from Louisville, Kentucky, and read local papers there. Trump is going to Louisville on Saturday. I have to assume that he will be pushing on Rand Paul. Conway called into a Louisville radio station this week to say that Paul should get behind the effort. Trump tweeted the same thing . If Trump goes to a member’s home state and pushes them on a bill, that is pretty involved. harry : I don’t think there’s any sign that Trump will give up on this bill. It’s just that this is a starting point. It’s essentially a blueprint. I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but that’s what the man said. Trump, in case you didn’t know, likes to think of himself as a negotiator. natesilver : But is Trump attached to getting this bill passed, or is he attached to getting some bill passed? Or does he just want to pick a fight with Rand Paul, who’s an easy target in some ways? micah : Good transition: Let’s talk endgames. What happens if they don’t pass anything? Clare, related to your big piece on Republican voters : Is there a revolt? clare.malone : There are certainly some in the GOP’s base — those who were, say, Ted Cruz voters in the primary who flipped to Trump out of pragmatism — who voted for Trump for certain promised legislation and executive action. More specifically, that was “repeal and replace Obamacare!” and “Supreme Court nominees!” that you heard at every campaign event during the primary season. So, if they weren’t to pass something, I’m not sure you’d see a revolt right away, per se, but that would give some cannon fire to primary challenges down the road, right? perry : I feel like the optimal goal for Republicans, other than passing a bill, is to have the bill fail but be able to blame it on someone else. And the Democrats have no power and can’t be blamed. I don’t think the Freedom Caucus wants to get blamed. Or Rand. Or Ryan. Or McConnell. Usually, this kind of bill would die in committee, without a real floor vote. Don’t think Ryan or McConnell can afford that. Read Sarah Kliff on the Senate parliamentarian and how she could rule that parts of the bill do not meet Senate rules for reconciliation. She is the perfect fall person. If they can blame her, that would be perfect for the Republicans: “The bill failed, but it was some government bureaucrat!” Is that too cynical? natesilver : I don’t think it’s too cynical, necessarily. They’re in a real pickle. The other way they could try to get a similar result is to intentionally insert a provision in the bill that couldn’t pass through reconciliation instructions — e.g., allowing the sale of insurance across state lines — and then blame Democrats for killing things via the filibuster. micah : I think we’ve learned that there’s no such thing as “too cynical.” So you both think there won’t be a mass voter-led revolt if the GOP leaves Obamacare mostly as is? Even if they have a good fall person? harry : Which voters, Micah? Primary voters, maybe. Because general election voters probably will be fine with it . micah : Yeah, and to Clare’s point about Cruz voters: We learned there weren’t many of those. clare.malone : Like, a tea party type deal? micah : Tea party-lite? clare.malone : I don’t think that would happen, given how much full-on power Republicans have right now. Psychologically, I’m not sure the GOP’s base is there. They would be angry, yes, but not fire-ants-in-their-pants angry. perry : I’ve always believed the conservative opposition to Obamacare would be less intense after Jan. 19, 2017. I wonder if there will be much of a backlash at all if this fails. micah : The opposition was always more about the “Obama” than the “care,” in other words. harry : Only 31 percent of Republicans want to repeal the law without a replacement package in place, so I’m going to agree with the panel here. Many want repeal, for sure, but even many Republicans don’t want to throw the baby out with bathwater. micah : The lower-third on CNN right now is “Sources: Trump fully committed to selling health bill.” clare.malone : If the chyron says it, it must be true. micah : Words to live by. natesilver : I’m going to change my name to Nate Sources. micah : So, before we begin to wrap up, I just want to make sure that we’re not getting carried away with how much danger this effort is in. To recap, the consensus seems to be that Republicans botched the health care bill rollout, the bill pleases no one, Trump will push for it but may abandon the effort if the going gets tough, GOP voters wouldn’t freak out too much if something doesn’t pass and some Republican leaders may not even be trying to pass anything. clare.malone : Well, the ultimate endgame is that none of us are making it out alive. harry : The math for the Republicans is rather simple: To repeal, they need their caucuses to vote aye. They don’t need to get any Democratic votes. That in itself is a reason to be optimistic for Republicans that a bill could pass. Perhaps it’s not this bill, but a bill. natesilver : Being alive is a pre-existing condition, which unfortunately isn’t covered. micah : Being alive is an existing condition, Nate. perry : I don’t agree with the consensus then. I think the bill has a good chance of passing the House, since I don’t see the 22 votes against. And I don’t right now see the third vote against in the Senate. If they can get this bill to votes, I think it can pass. I don’t think a long process of amending the bill will be that helpful to passing it. micah : I may or may not have exaggerated the consensus. clare.malone : i.e., partisanship is a hell of a drug? (to Perry’s point). natesilver : I agree with the consensus, as laid out by Micah, and also think the bill has a chance of passing! They aren’t mutually exclusive. perry : I’m not predicting passage. micah : SOURCES: PERRY PREDICTS HEALTH CARE BILL WILL PASS! natesilver : :champagne: perry : Exactly! I think Nate is right: This all looks terrible right now, but the bill could still pass. Is that the consensus? micah : I think so, yeah. (I don’t think we’ve ever reached consensus in a chat before.) natesilver : Look, Republicans will get their act a little bit more together, partisanship will help at the margins, and maybe Trump can intimidate a few wanderers into supporting the bill. On the other hand, there are some big public relations blows yet to navigate, like the CBO score and whatever pushback they get from constituents at the spring recess. I think the modal (most likely) scenario is that the House passes a more conservative bill than what’s on the table now and it gets stymied in the Senate. perry : I think I agree with this, while not being sure what “stymied” in the Senate looks like. natesilver : Yeah. It could die with a bang rather than a whimper, get filibustered, get ruled out of order by the parliamentarian, or lose on a floor vote. Lots of ways it could die. Or the Senate could gut the bill and do something token-ish that was actually fairly popular and dare the House to pass it in order to save face. micah : OK — any final thoughts? harry : This is just the beginning. Remember how long it took for the ACA to pass? It was long enough for Democrats to have 60 votes in the Senate when it started and then need reconciliation to pass the final parts because Scott Brown won the special election in Massachusetts. natesilver : To me, it’s interesting that Obamacare sort of spontaneously became more popular the moment that Trump won the election. That’s suggestive to me that there isn’t much of a mandate for what the House bill might do and certainly not what the House Freedom Caucus’s version of a bill might do. If the House bill is polling at, I dunno, 35 percent favorable and 51 percent unfavorable, then how long is its lifespan going to be? harry : I saw a fascinating poll on this — about what made opinion flip. It seemed, to the authors of the poll, that it wasn’t the underlying parts of the ACA. Opinions on those stayed the same. Rather, they argued the popularity of the bill spiked because people were becoming more knowledgeable of what was in the law. natesilver : I don’t buy that interpretation, since the popularity spike came immediately after the election. harry : What interpretation would you buy? That people started thinking about it differently? natesilver : I think it was the public telling the GOP that it was on a leash. And that it didn’t have license to start messing with entitlement programs, even theretofore fairly unpopular entitlement programs. clare.malone : But Republicans did leave enough of the original elements of Obamacare in their plan to have it be called “ Obamacare Lite ” by some on the right. So there could still be something to the idea that people are more aware of aspects of it. perry : Micah has been predicting this process would go like 1993 and 2009 for weeks. I wasn’t so sure. It looks like he was right. harry : To Clare’s point — yes, there could something. Perhaps it’s both that and what Nate suggested. To Perry’s point, health care is really hard.

8.398574208432333e+17	Thu Mar 09 15:16:27 +0000 2017	"WASHINGTON ― A Republican House committee chair said he would like White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to keep his nose out of Congress’ business on Obamacare repeal, highlighting the tensions between the two branches as they try to come to an agreement on the best path forward.  “I will just point blank say that I would encourage Mr. Spicer if he’s going to start talking about my business to give me a darn call,” Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), the House Rules Committee chair, said Wednesday. “I try not to get in his business, and I don’t appreciate him getting in my business.” Spicer tried to assure reporters Wednesday that President Donald Trump ’s administration was approaching health care legislation thoughtfully by reaching out to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. “This was a full effort to reach out to members of the House and Senate. It’s going through regular order in the House. Every member of the House and Senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through the committee process and on the floor,” Spicer said in his press briefing. During a House Rules Committee hearing Wednesday, Ranking Member Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) brought up Spicer’s remarks. The committee decides how legislation will be treated, including whether there will be an “open rule” process that allows members to add amendments.  “We are very excited to hear this news,” Slaughter said.  But Sessions wasn’t on board with Spicer’s suggestion. He said he had never talked to the White House about whether there would be an open rule and stressed that the administration doesn’t get to control Congress. “That is in an entirely different article of the Constitution,” he said.  Sessions was clearly annoyed by the situation the White House put him in, and there was silence after he spoke, punctuated by Democrats then trying to lighten the mood by joking that they’d pass Sessions’ message along to Spicer. “He [Spicer] can be in his lane, and I can be in my lane, but he’s in my lane now. ... I did not pre-clear that and he did not call me,” Sessions continued, adding that he knows Spicer and considers him a “fine young man” nevertheless.  Watch Sessions’ comments:  Spicer did not return a request for comment. The White House and House GOP leaders have had trouble getting their entire caucus on-board with the repeal legislation, with conservatives threatening to revolt . Outside groups, including medical associations and conservative organizations , are also encouraging lawmakers to oppose the bill. But the White House has been stepping up its outreach to wavering lawmakers, trying to convince them that, in the end, something needs to be done to repeal Obamacare.  Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

8.398564234293412e+17	Thu Mar 09 15:12:29 +0000 2017	"WASHINGTON ― Since former President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2009, making birth control free for millions of women, unintended pregnancies fell 18 percent  and the U.S. abortion rate reached a record low .  Now, Republicans have proposed a replacement for Obamacare, which ― in the name of restricting abortion ― could have the opposite effect. The bill “defunds” Planned Parenthood , one of the leading providers of affordable contraception in the nation, by preventing Medicaid from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for its health and family planning services to poor women. And it would dramatically roll back Medicaid coverage in general, which accounts for three-quarters of all public dollars spent on family planning and pays for nearly half of U.S. births.  “This bill would be devastating to reproductive health for low-income Americans,” said Adam Sonfield, senior policy director for the Guttmacher Institute.  Kathleen Sebelius, former secretary of health and human services under Obama, said she finds the plan “baffling.”  “In the seven years since the Affordable Care Act has been passed, women have had access to contraception, including the whole range of services that the FDA has authorized,” she said. “And when teenagers for the first time could qualify for preventive care, which included contraception, the numbers of unplanned pregnancies and the numbers of abortions and the numbers of teen pregnancies have dropped dramatically in this country. So one could argue that by removing some of those features, the people who at least profess to be anti-abortion are actually going to be driving those numbers back up.” If “TrumpCare” did drive unintended pregnancies back up, for women who choose abortion the procedure would likely not be covered by insurance. The plan would essentially drive abortion coverage out of the individual insurance market by barring individuals and small businesses from using their federal tax credits to purchase an insurance plan that covers the procedure. It would cost a person upwards of $2,000 more per year to buy a health insurance plan that includes abortion coverage, which means that hardly anyone will buy those plans, and insurance companies will have little incentive to offer them at all. “It’s a real, I would say, direct government interference in anyone being able to select a plan that actually meets their needs and meets their own religious view of the world,” Sebelius said.  Republicans are going to have trouble passing their bill if it defunds Planned Parenthood: They have already lost the support two of their own female senators,  Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) , over the provision. They need 60 votes to advance the legislation, there are only 51 of them in the Senate, and they are unlikely to win over any Democrats by slashing family planning and Medicaid.  The New York Times reported on Monday that President Donald Trump, who has strongly endorsed the GOP’s plan, offered Planned Parenthood the chance to keep its Medicaid reimbursements if it stops offering abortion services.  “As I said throughout the campaign, I am pro-life and I am deeply committed to investing in women’s health and plan to significantly increase federal funding in support of non-abortion services such as cancer screenings,” Trump said. “Polling shows the majority of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, even those who identify as pro-choice. There is an opportunity for organizations to continue the important work they do in support of women’s health, while not providing abortion services.” Trump’s statement is misleading ― it’s already illegal for federal money to pay for abortions. And a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that  62 percent of Americans oppose defunding Planned Parenthood, while only 31 percent would support the move.  Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the family planning provider rejected Trump’s offer. “Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept,” she said. “Providing critical health care services for millions of American women is nonnegotiable.”   How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

8.398559527530168e+17	Thu Mar 09 15:10:37 +0000 2017	"I was amused by a recent letter to Peninsula Voices [“ Malkin negative ,” March 3] criticizing comments by conservative Friday columnist Michelle Malkin. In the letter, the writer describes her writings as “hate-filled,” “vitriolic” and “angry,” and asks the Peninsula Daily News to no longer carry her weekly columns. This writer admits to never reading Ms. Malkin’s writings because they are filled with “negativity,” are “divisive” and are “unkind.” How can this writer be so critical of a columnist she has not taken the time to even read but has found time to write the PDN criticizing Ms. Malkin?

It was a rebellion. America is having a civil war, or, to be more accurate, a War of Incivility. The weapons are (mostly) (so far) words. But — goodness! — the words we’ve heard. The war is not between Republicans and Democrats or between conservatives and progressives. The war is between the frightened and what they fear. It is being fought by the people who perceive themselves as controlling nothing. They are besieging the people they perceive as controlling everything.

That depends on how old you are and how much income you make, but where you live would matter a lot, too. Using Kaiser Family Foundation projections of the 2020 health care markets, NBC News mapped the winners and losers of the American Health Care Act relative to the Affordable Care Act. In short, higher-income earners and the young would see a benefit from the Republican bill. Lower-income earners and the old would tend not to. The reason for the change is all in how the bills provide tax relief for buying health care. Under Obamacare, tax subsidies are partly determined by the cost of local health care and are not given to higher earners. In the House bill, tax credits are pegged to income and age, and are available to higher earners. Should the House bill pass, Kaiser estimates that single filers making as much as $115,000 will benefit from a tax credit in 2020. Under Obamacare, the maximum amount someone can earn and still receive a subsidy in 2020 is approximately $50,000, 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Related: Experts: The GOP Health Care Plan Just Won't Work For lower earners in general, the subsidies for Obamacare tend to be more generous than those provided in the Republican tax credit. According to Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance at Kaiser, there are some states where tax credits for very low earners may be higher with the House plan, such as those that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA. Still, these credits may not be enough to make insurance actually affordable. Middle and lower-income older adults will generally pay more in Kaiser's 2020 projections, even though the GOP bill offers this group bigger tax credits. Obamacare set a rule that older adults would not be charged more than three times that of someone younger. The House bill ups that ceiling from three times as much to five times, negating the direct tax benefits in the Republican bill relative to the Obamacare baseline. "
